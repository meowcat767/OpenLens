Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[34] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5,[35] capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing.[36] As of 2025[update], the Python Software Foundation supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, following the projects annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates. Python has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[37][38][39][40] It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.[41] Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.[42] History Main article: History of Python The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at PyCon US 2024 Python was conceived in the late 1980s[43] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde \u0026 Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.[44] It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[45] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Python implemen",

PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.[13] It is supported on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses, data lakes,[14] or web services with many concurrent users. The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components. This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor. These include special-purpose database engine features, like those needed to support a geospatial[15] or temporal[16] database or features which emulate other database products.[17][18][19][20] Also available from third parties are a wide variety of user and machine interface features, such as graphical user interfaces[21][22][23] or load balancing and high availability toolsets.[24] The large third-party PostgreSQL support network of people, companies, products, and projects, even though not part of The PostgreSQL Development Group, are essential to the PostgreSQL database engine\u0027s adoption and use and make up the PostgreSQL ecosystem writ large.[25] PostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.[26][27] In 1996, the project was renamed PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.[28] History [edit] Ingres and University POSTGRES (1982–1994) [edit] PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, Michael Stonebraker, left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.[26] He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the Turing Award in 2014 for these and other projects,[29] and techniques pioneered in them. The new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types.[30] These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships – something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.[31] Starting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM SIGMOD Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers[32] and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2[33] on June 30, 1994 – primarily a cleanup – the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter, which could be interactively used with a console application named monitor. Postgres95 (1994–1996) [edit] In 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. The monitor console was also replaced by psql. Yu a",

It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.[19] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022[update] according to GitHub.[20] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[21] Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun\u0027s Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle, which bought Sun in 2010, offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM, which is open-source software used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. Java 25 is the version current as of September 2025[update]. Java 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25 are long-term support versions still under maintenance. History See also: Java (software platform) § History Duke, the Java mascot James Gosling, the creator of Java, in 2008 James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[22] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[23] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling\u0027s office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[24] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[25] Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[26] It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[27] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively. In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[28][29][30] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[31] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementatio",

Servers similar to this one are often used as web servers. Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website. Server farm with thousands of web servers used for super-high traffic websites ADSL modem running an embedded web server serving dynamic web pages used for modem configuration A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1][2][3][4][5] The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.[6] A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications. Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages. History [edit] First web proposal (1989) evaluated as \"vague but exciting...\" The world\u0027s first web server, a NeXT Computer workstation with Ethernet, 1990. The case label reads: \"This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!\" See also: History of the web browser, History of the World Wide Web, and History of the Internet This is a very brief history of web server programs, so some information necessarily overlaps with the histories of the web browsers, the World Wide Web and the Internet; therefore, for the sake of clarity and understandability, some key historical information below reported may be similar to that found also in one or more of the above-mentioned history articles.[7] Initial WWW project (1989–1991) [edit] In March 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system. The proposal titled \"HyperText and CERN\", asked for comments and it was read by several people. In October 1990 the proposal was reformulated and enriched (having as co-author Robert Cailliau), and finally, it was approved.[8][9][10] Between late 1990 and early 1991 the project resulted in Berners-Lee and his developers writing and testing several software libraries along with three programs, which initially ran on NeXTSTEP OS installed on NeXT workstations:[11][12][10] a graphical web browser, called WorldWideWeb; a portable line mode web browser; a web server, later known as CERN httpd. Those early browsers retrieved web pages written in a simple early form of HTML from web servers using a new basic communication protocol that was named HTTP 0.9. In August 1991 Tim Berners-Lee announced the birth of WWW technology and encouraged scientists to adopt and develop it.[13] Soon after, those programs, along with their source code, were made available to people interested in their usage.[11] Although the source code was not formally licensed or placed in the public domain, CERN informally allowed users and developers to experiment and further develop on top of them. Berners-Lee started promoting the adoption and the usage of those programs along with their porting to other operating systems.[10] Fast and wild development (1991–1995) [edit] In December 1991, the first web server outside Europe was installed at SLAC (U.S.A.).[12] This was a very important event because it started trans-continental web communications between web browsers and web servers.

The window decoration is either drawn by the window manager or by the client. The drawing of the content is the task of the client. In computing, a windowing system (or window system) is a software suite that manages separately different parts of display screens.[1] It is a type of graphical user interface (GUI) which implements the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) paradigm for a user interface. Each currently running application is assigned a usually resizable and usually rectangular surface of the display to present its GUI to the user; these windows may overlap each other, as opposed to a tiling interface where they are not allowed to overlap. Usually a window decoration is drawn around each window. The programming of both the window decoration and of available widgets inside of the window, which are graphical elements for direct user interaction, such as sliders, buttons, etc., is eased and simplified through the use of widget toolkits. Technical details [edit] The main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server, although alternative terms such as window server are also in use. Any application that runs and presents its GUI in a window, is a client of the display server. The display server and its clients communicate with each other over an application programming interface (API) or a communications protocol, which is usually called display server protocol, the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user. It receives all the input from the kernel, that the kernel receives from all attached input devices, such as keyboard, pointing devices, or touchscreen and transmits it to the correct client. The display server is also responsible for the output of the clients to the computer monitor. The output of sound is usually not managed by the display server, but the sound volume is usually handled through GUI applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top. A windowing system enables the computer user to work with several programs at the same time. Each program presents its GUI in its own window, which is generally a rectangular area of the screen.[citation needed] From a programmer\u0027s point of view, a windowing system implements graphical primitives. For example: rendering fonts or drawing a line on the screen. It provides an abstraction of the graphics hardware for use by higher-level elements of the graphical interface such as a window manager.[citation needed] A display server protocol can be network capable or even network transparent, facilitating the implementation of thin clients.[citation needed] Display server [edit] The basic components of a GUI: The display server implements the windowing system. A simple window manager merely draws the window decorations, but compositing window managers do more. A display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other. The display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol, a communications protocol, which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable. The display server is a key component in any graphical user interface, specifically the windowing system. The server/client relationship of a standalone display server is somewhat counterintuitive in that a \"server\" is usually thought of as a large, remote machine, whereas a standalone \"display server\" is a small local system, with most clients being executed on a larger central machine. The explanation is that a display server provides the services of a display and input devices. Display server communications protocols [edit] X11 [edit] Main articles: X Window System core protocol and X Window System The X.Org Server communicates with X clients (local or remote) and peripherals over the X11 protocol. X Window System logo The X Window System was first released in 1984 and is historically the main windowing system for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The core protocol has been at version 11 since 1987, hence it commonly being known as \"X11\". The current reference implementation of the X11 protocol is the X.Org Server, which provides the display server and some ancillary components. The X Window System does not define a look and feel; instead, users run a window manager (either standalone or part of a broader desktop environment) and applications designed using a widget toolkit.

Family of Unix-like operating systems This article is about the family of operating systems. For the kernel, see Linux kernel. For other uses, see Linux (disambiguation).

License GPLv2 (Linux kernel)[14][f] Official website kernel.org Articles in the series Linux kernel Linux distribution Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks)[16] is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[17] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[18][19][20] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.[21] Thousands of Linux distributions exist, many based directly or indirectly on other distributions;[22][23] popular Linux distributions[24][25][26] include Debian, Fedora Linux, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu, while commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and ChromeOS. Linux distributions are frequently used in server platforms.[27][28] Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and recommends the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.[29][30] Other than the Linux kernel, key components that make up a distribution may include a display server (windowing system), a package manager, a bootloader and a Unix shell. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. While originally developed for x86 based personal computers, it has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system,[31] and is used on a wide variety of devices including PCs, workstations, mainframes and embedded systems. Linux is the predominant operating system for servers and is also used on all of the world\u0027s 500 fastest supercomputers.[g] When combined with Android, which is Linux-based and designed for smartphones, they have the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. Overview [edit] The Linux kernel was designed by Linus Torvalds, following the lack of a working kernel for GNU, a Unix-compatible operating system made entirely of free software that had been undergoing development since 1983 by Richard Stallman. A working Unix system called Minix was later released but its license was not entirely free at the time[32] and it was made for an educative purpose. The first entirely free Unix for personal computers, 386BSD, did not appear until 1992, by which time Torvalds had already built and publicly released the first version of the Linux kernel on the Internet.[33] Like GNU and 386BSD, Linux did not have any Unix code, being a fresh reimplementation, and therefore avoided the legal issues.[34] Linux distributions became popular in the 1990s and effectively made Unix technologies accessible to home users on personal computers whereas previously it had been confined to sophisticated workstations.[35] Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME, KDE Plasma or Xfce. Distributions intended for servers may not have a graphical user interface at all or include a solution stack such as LAMP. The source code of Linux may be used, modified, and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). The license means creating novel distributions is permitted by anyone[36] and is easier than it would be for an operating system such as macOS or Microsoft Windows.[37][38][39] The Linux kernel, for example, is licensed under the GPLv2, with an exception for system calls that allows code that calls the kernel via system ca",

It consists of an outer ring of vertical sarsen standing stones, each around 13 feet (4.0 m) high, seven feet (2.1 m) wide, and weighing around 25 tons, topped by connecting horizontal lintel stones which are held in place with mortise and tenon joints—a feature unique among contemporary monuments.[2][3] Inside is a ring of smaller bluestones. Inside, these are free-standing trilithons, two bulkier vertical sarsens joined by a single lintel. The whole monument, now in ruins, is aligned towards the sunrise on the summer solstice and sunset on the winter solstice. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the densest complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred tumuli (burial mounds).[4] Stonehenge was constructed in several phases beginning about 3100 BC and continuing until about 1600 BC. The famous circle of large sarsen stones was placed between 2600 BC and 2400 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the bluestones were given their current positions between 2400 and 2200 BC,[5] although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC.[6][7][8] One of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom, Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon.[9] It has been a legally protected scheduled monument since the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 was passed.[1] The site and its surroundings were added to UNESCO\u0027s list of World Heritage Sites in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown Estate and managed by English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.[10][11] Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings.[12] Deposits containing human bone date from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were first dug, and continued for at least another 500 years.[13] Etymology Watercolour of Stonehenge by Lucas de Heere, 1574[a] The Oxford English Dictionary cites Ælfric\u0027s 10th-century glossary, in which henge-cliff is given the meaning \u0027precipice\u0027, or stone; thus, the stanenges or Stanheng \"not far from Salisbury\" recorded by 11th-century writers are \"stones supported in the air\". In 1740, William Stukeley notes: \"Pendulous rocks are now called henges in Yorkshire ... I doubt not, Stonehenge in Saxon signifies the hanging stones.\"[16] Christopher Chippindale\u0027s Stonehenge Complete gives the derivation of the name Stonehenge as coming from the Old English words stān \u0027stone\u0027, and either hencg \u0027hinge\u0027 (because the stone lintels hinge on the upright stones) or hen(c)en \u0027to hang\u0027 or \u0027gallows\u0027 or \u0027instrument of torture\u0027 (though elsewhere in his book, Chippindale cites the \u0027suspended stones\u0027 etymology).[17] The \"henge\" portion has given its name to a class of monuments known as henges.[16] Archaeologists define henges as earthworks consisting of a circular banked enclosure with an internal ditch.[18] As often happens in archaeological terminology, this is a holdover from antiquarian use.

Mike Parker Pearson, leader of the Stonehenge Riverside Project based around Durrington Walls, noted that Stonehenge appears to have been associated with burial from the earliest period of its existence: Stonehenge was a place of burial from its beginning to its zenith in the mid third [sic] millennium B.C.

It is located on the island of Great Britain, of which it covers about 62%, and more than 100 smaller adjacent islands. England shares a land border with Scotland to the north and another land border with Wales to the west, and is otherwise surrounded by the North Sea to the east, the English Channel to the south, the Celtic Sea to the south-west, and the Irish Sea to the west. Continental Europe lies to the south-east, and Ireland to the west. At the 2021 census, the population was 56,490,048. London is both the largest city and the capital. The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic. It takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had extensive cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century.[7] The Kingdom of England, which included Wales after 1535, ceased to be a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union brought into effect a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland that created the Kingdom of Great Britain.[8] England is the origin of the English language, the English legal system (which served as the basis for the common law systems of many other countries), association football, and the Anglican branch of Christianity; its parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations.[9] The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world\u0027s first industrialised nation.[10] England is home to the two oldest universities in the English-speaking world: the University of Oxford, founded in 1096, and the University of Cambridge, founded in 1209. Both universities are ranked amongst the most prestigious in the world.[11][12] England\u0027s terrain chiefly consists of low hills and plains, especially in the centre and south. Upland and mountainous terrain is mostly found in the north and west, including Dartmoor, the Lake District, the Pennines, and the Shropshire Hills. The London metropolitan area has a population of over 15 million as of 2025, representing the United Kingdom\u0027s largest metropolitan area. England\u0027s population of 56.3 million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century.[13] Toponymy See also: Toponymy of England The name \"England\" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means \"land of the Angles\".[14] The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages. They came from the Angeln region of what is now the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.[15] The earliest recorded use of the term, as \"Engla londe\", is in the late-ninth-century translation into Old English of Bede\u0027s Ecclesiastical History of the English People. The term was then used to mean \"the land inhabited by the English\", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of Northumbria.

At first a supporter of James Buchanan, whom he succeeded in the Senate when Buchanan became Secretary of State in 1845, Cameron broke with Buchanan and the Democrats by the 1850s. An opponent of slavery, he briefly joined the Know Nothings before winning another term in the Senate as a Republican in 1857. He helped nominate and elect Lincoln, but rumors of corruption surrounded him; it was with reluctance that Lincoln appointed him to the cabinet. He did not do well in his post, and Lincoln made him minister to Russia in 1862, a post he held briefly. He rebuilt his political machine in Pennsylvania, winning a third term in the Senate in 1867. After ten years he resigned, arranging the election of his son, Don Cameron, in his place. Simon Cameron lived to age 90; his machine dominated local politics until the 1920s. (Full article...)

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia US policemen enforcing federal laws on natives A Southern Cheyenne Indian policeman, c. 1889 Indian agency police were policemen hired by the United States government’s Indian agents during the late 19th and early 20th century, it was assigned to members of American Indian tribes. It was the duty of Indian agency police to enforce federal laws, the laws of the state where their reservation was located, and the terms of the federal treaties with their tribal authority. The very first Indian police made their appearance in the Great Plains in the 1830s. This was partly due to the relocation of tribes such as the Cherokee into Indian territories.[1] Many tribes had no recognizable governments and therefore no tribal laws. On these tribes\u0027 reservations, the Indian agent hired tribal members to effect law and order according to federal, agency, and treaty rules. Some tribes, such as the Cherokee, had well-developed systems of tribal laws and tribal courts; the agency police also enforced these laws, and they testified and maintained order in the tribal courts. Since the agency police were federal officers, crimes against them had to be tried in a United States district court. Indian policemen had a wide range of responsibilities, such as maintaining law and order, protecting agency property, arresting offenders, managing jails, and serving as messengers. They also patrolled reservation boundaries, detaining thieves and enforcing various bans.[1] They often faced danger, with at least twenty-four officers losing their lives in Indian Territory (modern day-Oklahoma) alone between 1876 and 1906. The deadliest incident occurred on December 15, 1890, when six members of Standing Rock\u0027s Indian police force were killed while trying to apprehend Sitting Bull. Members of the Indian agency police were also responsible for the death of Sitting Bull and 12 other American Indians.[1][2] See also [edit] Australian native police Indian tribal police Lighthorse (American Indian police) Sitting Bull United States Indian Police Bureau of Indian Affairs Police References [edit] ^ a b c \"Encyclopedia of the Great Plains | INDIAN POLICE\". plainshumanities.unl.edu.

December’s featured text Grab a download! Little Elephant\u0027s Christmas (1938) by Heluiz Chandler Washburne, the second instalment in her Little Elephant children\u0027s book series, is a heartwarming tale of a young elephant\u0027s anticipation and celebration of Christmas. It captures the excitement of receiving and giving gifts, decorating the Christmas tree, and spending time with family. As Little Elephant engages in holiday activities, such as helping with the Christmas pudding and opening his stocking filled with surprises, the story conveys the magic and joy of the festive season through the eyes of a child. Little Elephant was all excited. In a few days it would be Christmas. School was over and snow lay white and thick on the ground. Many times each day the bell in the kitchen went ting-a-ling-a-ling and Little Elephant rushed to the door to see who was there. Sometimes it was the expressman who drove up in a truck and dumped a big box or two. Sometimes it was the postman who came up the path with a mail bag of little bundles swinging from his trunk. There were long bundles, short bundles, flat bundles, round bundles, thin bundles, square bundles—bundles, bundles, bundles! And all of them were pasted over with bright red Christmas seals. . . .

He also served as the 17th United States secretary of state from 1845 to 1849 and represented Pennsylvania in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Buchanan was an advocate for states\u0027 rights, particularly regarding slavery, and minimized the role of the federal government preceding the American Civil War. Buchanan was a lawyer in Pennsylvania and won his first election to the state\u0027s House of Representatives as a member of the Federalist Party. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820 and retained that post for five terms, aligning with Andrew Jackson\u0027s Democratic Party. Buchanan served as Jackson\u0027s minister to Russia in 1832. He was elected a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania in 1834 and served for 11 years. He was appointed to serve as President James K. Polk\u0027s secretary of state in 1845, and eight years later was named as President Franklin Pierce\u0027s minister to the United Kingdom. Beginning in 1844, Buchanan became a regular contender for the Democratic Party\u0027s presidential nomination. He was nominated and won the 1856 presidential election. As President, Buchanan intervened to assure the Supreme Court\u0027s majority ruling in the pro-slavery decision in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case. He acceded to Southern attempts to engineer the Kansas Territory\u0027s entry into the Union as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution, and angered not only Republicans, but also Northern Democrats. Buchanan honored his pledge to serve only one term and supported his Vice President John C. Breckinridge\u0027s unsuccessful candidacy in the 1860 presidential election. He failed to reconcile the fractured Democratic Party amid the grudge against Stephen A. Douglas, leading to the election of Republican and former Congressman Abraham Lincoln. Buchanan\u0027s leadership during his lame duck period, before the American Civil War, has been widely criticized. He simultaneously angered the North by not stopping secession and the South by not yielding to their demands. Buchanan supported the Corwin Amendment in an effort to reconcile the country. He made an unsuccessful attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter, but otherwise refrained from preparing the military. His failure to forestall the American Civil War has been described as incompetence, and he spent his last years defending his reputation. Historians and scholars r",

Haftanın seçkin maddesi Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), Avustralya\u0027ya özgü otobur ve ağaçta yaşayan bir keseli memeli hayvan türüdür. Phascolarctidae familyasının yaşayan tek temsilcisidir ve yaşayan en yakın akrabaları vombatlardır. Koalalar, Avustralya\u0027nın doğu ve güney kıyıları boyunca Queensland, Yeni Güney Galler, Victoria ve Güney Avustralya eyaletlerinde bulunur. Vücut uzunlukları 60 ila 85 cm, ağırlıkları ise 4 ila 15 kg arasında değişiklik gösterir. Kürkü, gümüşi gri ile çikolata rengi arasındaki renklerdedir. Kuzey popülasyonlarındaki bireyler, genellikle güneyde yaşayanlardan daha küçük ve daha açık renklidir. Bu iki popülasyonun alt türler olması konusu ise tartışmalıdır. Besinlerinin büyük bölümünü okaliptüs ağaçlarının yapraklarından elde eden koalalar, genelde bu ağaçlardan oluşan ormanlık alanlarda yaşar. Bu yaprakların besin değeri ve kalori içeriği sınırlı olduğundan dolayı koalalar genellikle sedanter bir yaşam sürer ve günde 20 saate kadar uyur. (Devamı...)

Kao spin-off serije Age of Empires, Age of Mythology crpi dio inspiracije iz mitologije i legendi Grka, Egipćana i Nordijaca, a ne iz stvarnih historijskih događaja. Mnogi elementi igranja slični su serijalu Age of Empires, dok mitološka stvorenja i natprirodne moći igranje podižu izvan područja realizma. Kampanja prati atlantskog admirala Arkantosa, koji je prisiljen putovati kroz zemlje tri kulture u igri, loveći kiklopa koji je u savezu s Posejdonom protiv Atlantide.

Some things never change... AndyTheGrump (talk) 02:18, 9 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] At least this adds to the pool of possible names for Wikipedia\u0027s house band. \"Published by Canibals\" is a bit long to fit nicely on a t-shirt though.

Әдебиет тарихында жоғалған ұрпақ деп аталып кеткен ағымның басты өкілі ретінде осы Хемингуэйды атауға болады. Бірінші дүниежүзілік соғыс салдарынан сенімдерінен айырылып, махаббаттарын жоғалтып, сенделіп, мəңгіріп қалған жазушы-ақындар шығармаларында сол заманның пессимистік келбетін бейнелеген. Жеті роман жазып, төрт әйелмен бас құраған, үш соғысты көрген, екі рет қатерлі ұшақ апатынан аман қалған жазушы отбасының ортаншысы еді. Майдан кешкен жан бола тұрып, соғыстың қатыгез картинасын емес, оның салдарынан зардап шеккендердің «бейбіт өмірін» басынан өткізді. Кейіпкерлерін табанды, батыл, жаужүрек қылып көрсете білді.

Жаратылыстану ғылымдарының бір саласы. Ол тіршілік құбылыстарының бәрін, тірі ағзалардың құрылысы мен қызметін, олардың табиғи бірлестіктерін, таралуын, эволюциясын, өзара бір-бірімен және өлі табиғатпен байланысын зерттейді. Биологияның негізгі міндеті — бүкіл органикалық дүниенің (жануарлардың, өсімдіктердің, саңырауқұлақтардың, бактериялардың, вирустардың) қасиеттерін, пайда болуы мен даму заңдылықтарын зерттеу арқылы жалпы тіршіліктің мәнін анықтау, оны басқару, мақсатқа сай өзгерту әдістерін табу. Биологияның жалпы халық шаруашылығында, әсіресе медицина мен ауыл шаруашылығында маңызы аса зор.

The 184-kilometre (114 mi)-long river is one of the dominant waterways in South East Queensland that drains the southern ranges of the Scenic Rim and empties into Moreton Bay after navigating the City of Logan, a major suburban centre located south of Brisbane. The catchment is dominated by urban and agricultural land use. Near the river mouth are mangrove forests and a number of aquaculture farms.[4] Course and features [edit] Woodhill, 2016 Logan Bridge below Tamrookum, 1903 Bridge construction on the Logan River, 1930 The river rises below Mount Ernest on the southern slopes of the Scenic Rim, part of the Great Dividing Range and forms in the Mount Barney National Park, near the Queensland – New South Wales border, below Mount Lindesay. The river flows generally north by northeast, joined by eleven minor tributaries, before heading east and eventually emptying into Moreton Bay. Its principal tributaries are the Albert River which joins it just east of Beenleigh; Teviot Brook which begins at Mount Superbus and joins the Logan River at Cedar Pocket; and Burnett Creek which is subverted by the Maroon Dam west of Rathdowney. The river descends 380 metres (1,250 ft) over its 184-kilometre (114 mi) course.[1] The Mount Lindesay Highway via the Maclean Bridge at North Maclean, 2014 Logan River at Carbrook (left) and Alberton (right), 2014 In addition to the Scenic Rim, the Logan and its tributaries drain more than 3,000 square kilometres (1,200 sq mi) including the northern parts of the Border Ranges, the western slopes of the McPherson Range and the eastern slopes of the Main Range. The river\u0027s upper catchment is heavily influenced by the national parks of Tamborine, Mount Barney, Moogerah Peaks, Main Range and the Lamington Plateau, and numerous local government-owned reserves and conservation areas,[5] that comprise part of the Shield Volcano Group of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. The river is crossed by the Mount Lindesay Highway near Rathdowney and at North Maclean via Maclean\u0027s Bridge. The river is also crossed by the Pacific Motorway and the Old Pacific Highway south of Loganholme.[1] The Beenleigh railway line crosses the Logan between Loganlea and Bethania. A second rail crossing is planned to accommodate a doubling of rail tracks between the Kuraby and Beenleigh in time for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics.[6] Tidal waters reach to just downstream of the Maclean\u0027s Bridge.[3] Water harvesting [edit] Maroon Dam subverts Burnnett Creek, and supplies water to the Beaudesert Shire. Maroon is managed by SunWater and covers approximately 106 square kilometres (41 sq mi). The Queensland Government has considered several projects to supply water to its Southern Regional Pipeline. The Bromelton off-stream storage facility is under construction on the Logan River, outside Beaudesert, as is the Cedar Grove Weir, near Jimboomba. In 2006 the Queensland Government decided against the construction of a Logan River dam at Tilley\u0027s Bridge in Rathdowney due to mounting public pressure and high road diversion costs. Instead, the Wyaralong Dam was proposed on Teviot Brook near Boonah which will inundate fifteen properties instead of the one hundred properties for the Tilley\u0027s Bridge site. The",

For other uses, see Secretary of War (disambiguation). This article is about the historical position (1789–1947). For the modern position, see United States Secretary of Defense.

Appointer The president with Senate advice and consent Term length No fixed term Precursor Secretary at War Formation September 12, 1789 First holder Henry Knox Final holder Kenneth C. Royall Abolished September 18, 1947 Superseded by Secretary of Defense Secretary of the Army Secretary of the Air Force Succession 6th in the line of succession The secretary of war was a member of the U.S. Cabinet, beginning with George Washington\u0027s administration. A similar position, called either \"Secretary at War\" or \"Secretary of War\", had been appointed to serve the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation between 1781 and 1789. Benjamin Lincoln and later Henry Knox held the position. When Washington was inaugurated as the first president under the Constitution, he appointed Knox to continue serving as secretary of war. The secretary of war was the head of the War Department. At first, he was responsible for the United States Army and the Navy. In 1798, the secretary of the Navy was created by statute, and the scope of responsibility for the War Department was reduced to the Army. From 1886 onward, the secretary of war was in the line of succession to the presidency, after the vice president of the United States, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the president pro tempore of the Senate and the secretary of state. In 1947, with the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, the secretary of war was replaced by the secretary of the Army and the secretary of the Air Force and a new secretary, the secretary of defense, was created for coordination of the services. Since 1949, the service secretaries, Army, Air Force, and Navy, have been non-Cabinet subordinates under the secretary of defense. The secretary of the Army\u0027s office is generally considered the direct successor to the secretary of war\u0027s office, with the new secretary of defense taking the secretaries of war and navy positions in the Cabinet, and the line of succession to the presidency. List of secretaries [edit] Secretary at War (1781–1789) [edit] The office of secretary at war was modeled upon Great Britain\u0027s secretary at war, who was William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington, at the time of the American Revolution. The office of secretary at war was meant to replace both the commander-in-chief and the Board of War, and like the president of the board, the secretary wore no special insignia. The inspector general, quartermaster general, commissary general, and adjutant general served on the secretary\u0027s staff. However, the Army itself under Secretary Henry Knox only consisted of 700 men.

Li sendube estas la plej populara flandra majstro de la baroka periodo per troigo de la emfazigitaj movoj, koloroj, kaj sensiveco, kiu disvolvigis fakulajn aspektojn de klasika kaj kristana historio. Oni lin nomas ankaŭ Peter Paul, Pieter Paul, Pieter Pauwel aŭ Petrus Paulus. Li estis konata ĉefe pro kontraŭreformaciaj altarpecoj (retabloj), portretoj, pejzaĝoj, kaj historiaj pentraĵoj de mitologiaj kaj alegoriaj temoj.

Ĝi celas liveri en Esperanto liberan, objektivan kaj kontroleblan enhavon, kiun ĉiuj povas redakti. La projekto estas difinita de la kvin principoj. La enhavo estas disponigata sub la permesilo Krea Komunaĵo Atribuite-Samkondiĉe kaj oni povas kopii kaj reuzi ĝin sub la sama permesilo — eĉ por komercaj celoj — nur respektante la uzkondiĉojn. Ĉiuj redaktantoj de Esperanta Vikipedio estas volontuloj. Ili partoprenas en la kunlaborema komunumo, sen estro, kie la anoj kunordigas siajn strebojn kadre de temaj projektoj kaj pluraj diskutejoj. Ili sekvas la bazajn regulojn establitajn de la komunumo, ekzemple kontrolebleco de la informo aŭ la menciindeco de la temo. Inter la diversaj helpopaĝoj disponeblaj al uloj interesataj kontribui, estas la paĝoj, kiuj instruas kiel krei paĝon aŭ kiel redakti paĝon. Se vi havas demandojn, ne hezitu demandi.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 1867 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania ← 1861 January 15, 1867 1873 → Nominee Simon Cameron Edgar Cowan Party Republican Republican Alliance Democratic Leg. vote 82 49 Percentage 62.60% 37.40% Senate ballot House ballot Cameron: Cowan: No vote: U.S. senator before election Edgar Cowan Republican Elected U.S. Senator Simon Cameron Republican On January 15, 1867, Simon Cameron was elected to the United States Senate by the Pennsylvania General Assembly for the third time; it had previously chosen him in 1845 and 1857. The legislature voted for Cameron over the incumbent, Senator Edgar Cowan, who, though a Republican, was endorsed by the Democratic legislative caucus. With the Republican Party holding a large majority in the legislature, the main battle was for its endorsement: the caucus of Republican legislators had voted for Cameron over Governor Andrew Curtin. Cameron and Curtin each led a different faction of the Republican Party and had clashed as early as 1855, resulting in a bitter rivalry. Cameron tried to prevent Curtin from getting the Republican nomination for governor in 1860, while Curtin attempted to stop Cameron from receiving a post in Abraham Lincoln\u0027s cabinet; each was unsuccessful. Cameron\u0027s time as Secretary of War ended with his resignation under pressure, and he sought, unsuccessfully, to return to the Senate in 1863. With Curtin\u0027s second term as governor ending in 1867 and Cameron still wanting to return to the Senate, each sought Cowan\u0027s seat. Cowan had moved away from the Republican mainstream, becoming an ally of President Andrew Johnson, and was not a contender for the party endorsement. Others seeking the Republican nomination included Representative Thaddeus Stevens and Galusha Grow, a former speaker of the House of Representatives, but they needed a deadlock between the main contenders to have a chance. Both Cameron and Curtin sought support from among Republican candidates for the legislature, and also tried to place their supporters in positions that might influence the outcome. Curtin supporter Matthew Quay was the favorite to become Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, but the other Senate contenders combined to defeat him, and the victor, Cameron supporter John P. Glass, used his powers to influence Republican legislators. Cameron received the necessary majority of Republican legislators to gain the party\u0027s endorsement, while Cowan was endorsed by the Democrats. When the legislature voted, Cameron easily defeated Cowan, and served in the Senate until 1877; his powerful political machine dominated Pennsylvania politics for a half century. Curtin eventually switched to the Democratic Party, and served three terms in the House of Representatives in the 1880s; Cowan never held public office again.

Deig (c. 1909 – October 28, 1960) was an American athlete and sports coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of St. Thomas from 1946 to 1957, the head basketball coach at St. Thomas from 1940 to 1946, and the athletic director of St. Thomas from 1941 to 1958. He played college football at Marquette University. Early life and education [edit] Francis J. Deig was born in c. 1909 and grew up in the Mount Vernon, Indiana, area.[1][2] He first attended St. Matthew Parochial School before transferring to Mount Vernon High School.[2] He later transferred a second time to Jasper Academy, where he starred in football, basketball, and baseball.[2] He had a batting average of .484 as a senior at Jasper Academy, a record that was still standing by 1949.[2] After graduating from there, Deig enrolled at Marquette University.[2] He played football at Marquette and reportedly earned All-American honors as well as All-Western honors.[2] At Marquette, he played from 1928 to 1930 as a fullback,[3][4] gaining a reputation as a hard-hitter.[5] As a senior in 1930, he scored five touchdowns and placed second on the team in scoring with 30 points.[3][4] At the conclusion of his collegiate career, he was selected for the Dixie Classic all-star game.[2] According to The Minneapolis Star, Deig was considered one of Marquette\u0027s greatest fullbacks.[6] His fame at Marquette led to him receiving a position at a Milwaukee restaurant.[6] According to the Star, there, His duties were to visit the cafe each day, sit at a center table, order, and eat. It was also stipulated that Deig had to eat with relish and with gusto, including polite smacking of the lips and long, contented sighs ... And – emblazoned all over the glittering restaurant front was this sign: \"DEIG EATS HERE.\"[6] Coaching career [edit] Deig joined St. Augustine High School in 1934, coaching their football and basketball teams.[7][8][9] The 1935 football team went undefeated and scored 275 points, the highest among state high schools.[10][11] A 1936 article in the Star Tribune wrote \"Down at Austin they are mighty proud of the St. Augustine high school team ... The team is coached by Francis Deig, former Marquette university end [sic][a] who won All-American mention four years ago. All of the townspeople are talking about it. The team is big and experienced. Deig has been working on his present squad for three years and many say it is one of the best coached they have ever seen.\"[12] In 1937, Deig became a coach and physical education faculty at Saint Thomas Academy.[6][13] Through October 1937, he had won 24 straight games as a coach, including his time at St. Augustine.[8] He served as head basketball coach at Saint Thomas until 1940 and as head football coach through 1945.[14][15] His football team compiled a record of 52–11–7, winning six conference championships.[15] Deig and Jack Salscheider with the Cigar Bowl trophy in 1949 In 1940, Deig was appointed the athletic director and head basketball coach at the University of St. Thomas, replacing Nic Musty, whose resignation went into effect at the start of 1941.[14] By the start of 1946, his record as head basketball coach was 71–28.[15] In January 1946, he was named head football coach as well.[15] The 1946 St. Thomas football team went 4–3, placing second in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC).[16] In just his second year with the football team, Deig led them to the conference championship.[2] He led them to the championship again in 1948 and for a third consecutive year in 1949, also helping them achieve a Cigar Bowl berth in 1949.[2][16] The Cigar Bowl invitation was the first bowl invite ever for a team in the MIAC.[2] In 1956, he led St. Thomas to a fourth MIAC championship with an undefeated 8–0 record.[16] He resigned in 1958.[17][18][19] Deig received a Bachelor of Arts from St. Thomas in 1941. By the end of his coaching career, he held the school wins record and was the only coach in team history to have won four MIAC championships. His undefeated 1956 season earned him National Catholic Small College Coach of the Year honors. Deig was inducted into the University of St. Thomas Athletics Hall o",

Статия на седмицата Рибарско селище на остров Йоланд Йоланд е шведски остров, разположен в Балтийско море, близо до град Калмар. Със своите 1344 km2 това е и вторият по големина остров в Швеция (след Готланд). Населението на острова към 2013 година е 24 987 души, но по време на шведския празник Мидсомар на острова често се събират около 500 000 души. Остров Йоланд е естествено отделен от основната земя с протока Калмарсунд, но е достъпен посредством шесткилометровия мост Йоланд, изграден през 1972 година. Остров Йоланд е и най-малката историческа провинция на Швеция, която е част от бивше административно деление на Швеция. Съвременното административно деление включва остров Йоланд в рамките на лен Калмар. Островът има богата история, чието начало е поставено през 8 – 6 хилядолетие пр.н.е. с първите преселници. Редица археологически находки от каменната, желязната и викингската епоха, като фортификационни съоръжения, останки от селища и комплексни погребални церемонии, свидетелстват за живота на местното население и са ценен източник на информация за епохата. Историята на остров Йоланд продължава и през времената на Кралство Швеция, белязана от властта на шведските крале, а по-късно и от събитията около двете световни войни. Поминъкът на остров Йоланд е на основата на земеделие, риболов и търговия, като продължава да се базира на тези сектори и през 20 век. На острова съществуват няколко индустриални предприятия, но към 21 век повечето от тях са разрушени с изключение на няколко фабрики от леката промишленост. Туризмът е важно звено на приходи за острова, значително улеснен след построяването на моста над протока Калмарсунд. Островът се характеризира с дълга брегова ивица, редуваща абразивни, каменисти, песъчливи и тревисти плажове. Пясъчните плажове са сред най-дългите в Северна Европа. Водните ресурси на остров Йоланд са оскъдни, но въпреки това има малки езера, блата и реки.

Download this font: Ulfilas (by Robert Pfeffer). Don\u0027t speak Gothic? Gothic is an ancient East Germanic language spoken during the Dark Ages in Ukraine, Spain, Italy, and Aquitaine. It is the oldest Germanic language which we have a lot of knowledge of, and its vocabulary is highly similar to that of Old English. It is mostly known through a translation of the Bible made in the 4th century by Wulfila, but there are other writings in Gothic, such as a calendar, some records of financial transactions, and an explanation of the Bible known as the \"Skeireins\". Gothic is no longer spoken, and it has no descendants, but it can still be seen in Spanish, with words like \"ganso\" (goose), and in \"Bagme Bloma\", a poem by J.R.R. Tolkien written in a reconstructed form of Gothic. Gothic is written in an alphabet of its own.

The Coral Sea extends 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) down the Australian north-east coast to latitude 30° south.[3] Most of it is protected by the French Natural Park of the Coral Sea (French: Parc Naturel de la Mer de Corail) and the Australian Coral Sea Marine Park. The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, and the United States and Australia. The sea contains numerous islands and reefs (hence the name), as well as the world\u0027s largest reef system, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981. All previous oil exploration projects were terminated at the GBR in 1975, and fishing is restricted in many areas. The reefs and islands of the Coral Sea are particularly rich in birds and aquatic life and are a popular tourist destination, both domestically and internationally. Geography [edit] It is bounded in the west by the east coast of Queensland, thereby including the Great Barrier Reef, in the east by Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides) and by New Caledonia, and in the northeast approximately by the southern extremity of the Solomon Islands. In the northwest, it reaches to the south coast of eastern New Guinea, thereby including the Gulf of Papua. It merges with the Tasman Sea in the south, with the Solomon Sea in the north and with the Pacific Ocean in the east. On the west, it is bounded by the mainland coast of Queensland, and in the northwest, it connects with the Arafura Sea through the Torres Strait.[2] The sea is characterised by its warm climate, with frequent rains and tropical cyclones. Extent [edit] A map of the Coral Sea Islands While the Great Barrier Reef with its islands and cays belong to Queensland, most reefs and islets east of it are part of the Coral Sea Islands Territory. In addition, some islands west of and belonging to New Caledonia are also part of the Coral Sea Islands in a geographical sense, such as the Chesterfield Islands and Bellona Reefs. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Coral Sea as follows:[4] On the North.

At 656 miles (1,056 km), it is the longest state route in California, and the second-longest in the US after Montana Highway 200. SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a 54-mile (87 km) stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge. The highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas. Though some maps and signs mark SR 1 as continuous through the cities of Dana Point, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Oxnard, control of segments within those cities were relinquished to those local jurisdictions and are thus no longer officially part of the state highway system. The Golden Gate Bridge is also officially not included in the state highway system because it is maintained locally by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District. SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenery, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland. Route description [edit] Due to its fragmented nature and piecemeal relinquishments, the California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 1 across several subdivisions of section 301 as follows:[5] Route 1 is from: (a) Route 5 south of San Juan Capistrano to Route 101 near El Rio except for the portions of Route 1 relinquished: (1) Within the city limits of the City of Dana Point between the western edge of the San Juan Creek Bridge and Eastline Road at the city limits of the City of Laguna Beach. (2) Within the city limits of the City of Newport Beach between Jamboree Road and Newport Coast Drive. (3) Within the city limits of the City of Santa Monica between the southern city limits and Route 10. (4) Within the city limits of the City of Oxnard between Pleasant Valley Road and Route 101. (b) Route 101 at Emma Wood State Beach, 1.3 miles north of Route 33, to Route 101, 2.8 miles south of the Ventura-Santa Barbara county line at Mobil Pier Undercrossing. (c) Route 101 near Las Cruces to Route 101 in Pismo Beach via the vicinity of Lompoc, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Guadal",

Pretraži 96.271 članak 96.271 članak na bosanskom jeziku Napravi članak Sadržaj Portali Istaknuti članak Genocid u Srebrenici Memorijalni centar Srebrenica – Potočari Genocid u Srebrenici jest ratni zločin izvršen u julu 1995. za vrijeme rata u Bosni i Hercegovini. Genocid se sastojao od masovnih, planski provedenih ubistava zarobljenih bošnjačkih muškaraca i dječaka između 12 i 77 godina. Desio se u regionu Srebrenice, a izvršile su ga Vojska Republike Srpske pod komandom generala Ratka Mladića, te paravojna formacija \"Škorpioni\", zajedno s nekoliko stotina grčkih i ruskih dobrovoljaca. Događaj se smatra jednim od najvećih masakara u Evropi od Drugog svjetskog rata, u kojem je ubijeno više od 8000 ljudi. Masakr se generalno smatra jednim od najužasnijih događaja u savremenoj evropskoj historiji. General Ratko Mladić i grupa oficira Vojske Republike Srpske u međuvremenu su optuženi za ratne zločine, uključujući i genocid, pred Međunarodnim krivičnim sudom za bivšu Jugoslaviju (MKSJ). MKSJ je, između ostalog, donio pravosnažnu presudu u kojoj masakr u Srebrenici kvalificira kao čin genocida. Jednoglasnom presudom u slučaju Tužilac protiv Krstića 2004, Žalbeno vijeće Međunarodnog krivičnog suda za bivšu Jugoslaviju (MKSJ) presudilo je da zločin počinjen nad muškim stanovnicima enklave Srebrenica predstavlja genocid, zločin prema međunarodnom pravu. Presudu je podržao i Međunarodni sud pravde (ICJ) 2007. Zaključeno je da nasilno premještanje i zlostavljanje između 25.000 i 30.000 Bošnjakinja, djece i starijih osoba predstavlja genocid, zajedno sa ubistvima i razdvajanjem muškaraca koja su se desila tokom tog zločina.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Introduction to contributing to Wikipedia Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, written collaboratively by the people who use it. Since 2001, it has grown rapidly to become the world\u0027s largest reference website, with 7.1 million articles in English attracting billions of views every month. For a more detailed account of the project, see About Wikipedia. How you can contribute Don\u0027t be afraid to edit – Anyone can edit almost every page; just find something that can be improved and make it better! You can add content (using references to support your claims), upload free-to-use images, correct spelling and grammar mistakes, improve prose to make it more readable, or help with any number of other tasks. It\u0027s normal for new contributors to feel a little overwhelmed by all of our policies, but don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t understand everything at first. It\u0027s fine to use common sense as you edit, and if you accidentally make a mistake, another editor can always fix or improve it later. So go ahead, edit an article, and help make Wikipedia the world\u0027s best information source! Suggest improvements – Each article also has a \"Talk\" page, where you can suggest improvements and corrections to the article. Get to know some members of Wikipedia\u0027s diverse, enthusiastic community. Sign up for an account You\u0027re welcome to edit without creating an account, but there are many benefits of registering an account. It\u0027s quick and free. Sign up Want to try editing? You can test out how editing feels by editing one of the \"sandbox\" test pages below: Edit page visually or Edit using wiki markup Edit page visually or Edit using wiki markup Just type some text and click Publish page when you\u0027re happy with the way it looks. Don\u0027t worry about breaking anything; these pages are open areas just for experimentation! There\u0027s plenty more behind the scenes Wikipedia has many community pages in addition to its articles.

Latitude 42°29′ N to 45°56′ N Longitude 96°26′ W to 104°03′ W Website sd.gov South Dakota (/dəˈkoʊtə/ ⓘ;[9] Siouan languages: Dakȟóta itókaga, pronounced [daˈkˣota iˈtokaga]) is a state in the North Central region of the United States. It is also part of the Great Plains. South Dakota is named after the Dakota Sioux tribe, which comprises a large portion of the population and has historically dominated the territory.[10] South Dakota is the 17th-largest by area, the fifth-least populous, and the fifth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. Pierre is the state capital, and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 213,900,[11] is the most populous city.[12] The Missouri River bisects the state into two geographically and socially distinct halves colloquially known as \"East River\" and \"West River\".[13] South Dakota is bordered by North Dakota to the north, Minnesota to the east, Iowa to the southeast, Nebraska to the south, Wyoming to the west, and Montana to the northwest. Humans have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold rush in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of Indian wars, ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. As the southern part of the former Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. They are the 39th and 40th states admitted to the union; President Benjamin Harrison shuffled the statehood papers before signing them so that no one could tell which became a state first.[14] Major events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and the industrialization of agriculture, which has reduced family farming. Eastern South Dakota is home to most of its population, and a variety of crops grow in the area\u0027s fertile soil. West of the Missouri River, ranching is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low, pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, is in the southwest part of the state, and contains Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation levels ranging from moderate in the east to semiarid in the west. The state\u0027s ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome. Several Democrats represented South Dakota for multiple terms in both chambers of Congress, but the state government is largely controlled by the Republican Party, whose nominees have won the state in each of the last 14 presidential elections. Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to dive",

Mazkur mozaikalar madaniy meros obyekti sanalad Bu mozaikalar shaharning sovet modernizmi ruhida qayta qurilishi jarayonida, ayniqsa, 1966-yilgi Toshkent zilzilasidan keyin boshlangan keng qamrovli arxitektura va bezak sanʼati dasturlari doirasida vujudga kelgan. Asosan XX asrning 60-yillari oxirida Toshkent shahridagi yangi turarjoy majmualarining devorlariga terib chiqilgan. Mozaikalarning yaratilishi, bir tomondan, shaharga zamonaviy qiyofa berish, ikkinchi tomondan esa mehnat, xalqlar doʻstligi, tinchlik va ilm-fan rivoji kabi ideologiyalarni targʻib qilishga qaratilgan. Sovet Ittifoqi ommaviy monumental mozaikani badiiy mahorat va gʻoyalarni yetkazishning mukammal kombinatsiyasi sifatida koʻrgan. Badiiy ijod erkinligiga cheklovlar mavjud boʻlgan boʻlsa-da, koʻplab rassomlar ushbu sharoitda ham oʻziga xos individual uslublar yaratishga muvaffaq boʻlishgan. (Davomi...)

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Borders of the state of Queensland, Australia Queensland, the north-east state of Australia Queensland is the north-eastern state of Australia and has land borders with three other Australian states and territories: New South Wales (to the south), South Australia (to the south-west) and Northern Territory (to the west). To the north of Queensland is the Torres Strait separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea. To the east of Queensland is the Coral Sea, part of the Pacific Ocean. There are many islands off the Queensland coast which form part of the state of Queensland. The far western boundary with the Northern Territory is aligned along the 138th meridian east until Poeppel Corner at the intersection of this meridian and the 26th parallel south. It is here that Queensland borders South Australia. The boundary follows this latitude until it reaches the 141st meridian east at Haddon Corner where the border turns south reaching Cameron Corner on the 29th parallel south, the most western part of the border with New South Wales. The border follows this latitude towards the coast at about the 154th meridian east before following the courses of a number of rivers, then across a number of mountain ranges until it reaches Point Danger. From west to east, these rivers are the Barwon River, Macintyre River and Dumaresq River. Southern border towns include Mungindi, Goondiwindi and Texas. 1838 Royal Geographical Society proposal [edit] James Vetch proposal, 1838 By 1838 the coastline of the Australian continent had been well defined by mariners such as James Cook, Matthew Flinders and Phillip Parker King. As for the interior of Australia, little was known by the European settlers except for the area south of a line from Moreton Bay to Victoria as it is now (the south-east of the continent). This knowledge had been obtained from the journeys of explorers such as John Oxley, Charles Sturt, Thomas Mitchell, Allan Cunningham and George Evans.[1] There were many proposals for the subdivision of the Australian continent dating back to the 1830s. This proposal by Captain James Vetch[2] was published by the Royal Geographical Society in their journal of 1838. Vetch tried to give each colony equal areas, possess a tract of sea coast with possible harbour sites and be as compact as possible.[1] The boundaries of his proposed colonies were defined using lines of latitude and longitude. This was generally used by colonial administrators when there was either no natural features such as rivers and ranges or due to exploration of the country not being well enough advanced to know if there were any natural features.[1] 1846 colony of North Australia [edit] The southern boundary of the short-lived Colony of North Australia, 1846–1847, was further north than the later boundary of Queensland. The loss of the American Colonies due to the American War of Independence (1775–1783) forced the British Government to find another place to send its convicted felons. Its most recent acquisition (1770) New Holland (now Australia) was chosen and the first penal settlement established at Port Jackson in 1788 by Captain Arthur Phillip. Other settlements soon followed, Norfolk Island, Van Diemen\u0027s Land (now Tasmania), Port Macquarie and in 1824 Moreton Bay.[1] In 1840 the transportation of convicts to New South Wales ceased although Van Diemen\u0027s Land continued to receive large numbers of convicts. When William Ewart Gladstone became Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1845, he was confronted with the problem of the large numbers of pardoned convicts roaming around Van Diemen\u0027s Land unable to find work. Rather than revive transportation to New South Wales, which he knew would be very unpopular, he decided to create a new colony in the northern part of New South Wales. To this new colony he proposed to send the pardoned convicts of Van Diemen\u0027s Land, and he hoped that in time they could form the backbone of a new vibrant free colony.[1] In May 1846, Lieutenant Colonel George Barney of the Royal Engineers was chosen as the new colony administrative head. He was soon despatched to Sydney and instructed to find a suitable site to the north of Moreton Bay, but not that far north that the tropical climate would have an adverse effect on the health of the settlers, preventing them from hard work and industry. Port Curtis (now Gladstone in Queensland) was chosen. Also in the same month, the official Letters Patent were issued by Queen Victoria forming a new colony to be called North Australia. The southern boundary of this new colony was to be 26 degrees of south latitude (just south of present day Maryborough, Queensland).[1] On 8 January 1847, the Lord Auckland sailed from Sydney with the new colonial officials and their families arriving at Port Curtis on 25 January 1847. On entering the port the Lord Auckland grounded on a shoal. The officials quickly headed for shore and a few days l",

It is given to a video game judged to deliver the best experience across creative and technical fields. The award is traditionally accepted by the game\u0027s directors or studio executives. The process begins with over 100 video game publications and websites, which collectively name six games as nominees. After the nominees are selected, the winner is chosen by a combined vote between the jury (90%) and public voting (10%). Since its inception, the award has been given to eleven video games. Publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment has won the award three times and been nominated a record thirteen times, while FromSoftware is the only developer with more than one win. Bethesda Softworks and Capcom are the most nominated companies without a win at four. The most recent winner is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 by Sandfall Interactive. Process and history [edit] The Game Awards has a voting jury consisting of over 100 video game media and influencer outlets, which have been specifically selected for their work in critically evaluating video games. Each outlet completes an unranked ballot listing its top five choices; games with the most appearances across the ballots are selected as the nominees. The winners are determined between the jury (90%) and public voting (10%).[1] The public vote is held via the official website and social media platforms such as Discord, Facebook, and Twitter;[2][3] in China, fan voting is held via Bilibili.[1] Any game released before a certain date in November prior to the ceremony is eligible for award consideration.[4] As a result, any game released after the cutoff date is eligible in the following year\u0027s ceremony,[1] such as 2018\u0027s Super Smash Bros. Ultimate nominations at the Game Awards 2019;[5] similarly, games released between the ballot due date in early November and the cutoff date in mid-to-late November are often overlooked, such as Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in both 2019 and 2020[a] and Demon\u0027s Souls and Marvel\u0027s Spider-Man: Miles Morales in 2020.[4] Early access games available before the cutoff date are eligible, as are live service games regardless of their release year:[1] 2018\u0027s Among Us received several nominations in 2020.[9] Josef Fares presenting Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2022 The Game Award for Game of the Year is given to a video game judged to deliver the best experience across creative and technical fields.[10] It is presented as the final award of the ceremony and is widely considered its most prestigious honor.[11][12][13] Since 2017, the announcement of the winner has been preceded by a medley performance of the scores of each nominee by the Game Awards Orchestra, conducted by Lorne Balfe.[14][15] The category was expanded from five to six nominees in 2018.[16] The award is traditionally accepted by the director of the winning game or an executive from the studio; the first award in 2014 was accepted by Dragon Age: Inquisition executive producer Mark Darrah and BioWare general manager Aaryn Flynn.[17] The Game Awards host and producer Geoff Keighley presented the award for the first four ceremonies.[11][18][19][20] Other presenters include directors of past winners—such as 2016 winner Overwatch\u0027s lead director Jeff Kaplan in 2018,[21] 2020 winner The Last of Us Part II\u0027s creative director Neil Druckmann in 2021,[12] 2021 winner It Takes Two\u0027s director Josef Fares in 2022,[22] 2023 winner Baldur\u0027s Gate 3\u0027s director Swen Vincke in 2024,[23] and 2024 winner Astro Bot\u0027s director Nicolas Doucet in 2025[24]—and celebrity guests like Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez in 2019,[25] Christopher Nolan in 2020,[26] and Timothée Chalamet in 2023.[27] Winners and nominees [edit] Acceptees of the award Mark Darrah for Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014) Marcin Iwiński for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015) Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017) Cory Barlog for God of War (2018) Hidetaka Miyazaki for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019) and Elden Ring (2022) Neil Druckmann for The Last of Us Part II (2020) Josef Fares for It Takes Two (2021) Swen Vincke for Baldur\u0027s Gate 3 (2023) Nicolas Doucet and Masayuki Yamada for Astro Bot (2024) Guillaume Broche for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (2025) Winners are listed first, highlighted in yellow and boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡).

On a chaidh a lorg, canar Rìgh Tut ris gu tric. Bha ainm tùsail, Tutankhaten, a’ ciallachadh \"dealbh beò Aten agus tha Tutankhamun a’ ciallachadh \"dealbh beò Amun\".

Лишайникларда автотроф фикобиопт (суүсем) һәм гетеротроф микобионт (гөмбә) бердәм симбиотик организм хасил итеп тереклек итә. Шул сәбәпле, ирекле яшәүче суүсемнәрдән һәм гөмбәләрдән алар морфологик, анатомик, физиологик, биохимик, экологик яктан аерылып тора. Лишайникларның икеле табигатен беренче булып 1867 елда немец ботанигы Симон Швендерер ачыклаган. Хәзерге вакытта лишайникларның 26 000 төре билгеле. Аларны өйрәнүче фән лихенология дип атала. Микобионт күбесенчә сумкалы гөмбәләргә карый. Кайбер субтропик һәм тропик лишайникларның гына гөмбәсе базидиомицетларга керә. Архив • Кандидатлар • Төзәтү Сез беләсезме?

The CRPF assists states and Union Territories in maintaining law and order and internal security. It is composed of the Central Reserve Police Force (Regular) and Central Reserve Police Force (Auxiliary). It was established on 27 July 1939 as Crown Representative\u0027s Police with the objective of providing security to the British Crown Representatives in India. The force was later renamed as the Central Reserve Police Force by an Act of Parliament in 1949. The CRPF played a major role in the Parliamentary elections of September 1999.[3] The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is the largest central armed police force in India, comprising 247 battalions and exceeding a total strength of 301,376 personnel, as of 2019.[4] CRPF officers are also deployed in United Nations missions.

After Independence, the force was renamed the Central Reserve Police Force by an Act of Parliament on 28 December 1949. This Act constituted CRPF as an armed force of the Union. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the then Home Minister, visualised a multi-dimensional role for it in tune with the changing needs of a newly independent nation. The force played a significant role during the amalgamation of the princely States into the Indian Union. It helped the Union Government discipline the rebellious princely State of Junagadh and the small principality of Kathiawar in Gujarat which had declined to join the Indian Union. During the early 1950s, the performance of the CRPF detachments in enforcing law and order in Bhuj, the then Patiala and East Punjab States Union and Chambal ravines was appreciated by all quarters. On 21 October 1959, SI Karam Singh and 20 other CRPF personnel were attacked by the Chinese Army at Hot Springs in Ladakh resulting in 10 casualties. The survivors were imprisoned. Since then, 21 October has been observed as Police Commemoration day nationwide, across all states in India.[5] In the late 50s and early 60s, contingents of the CRPF were sent to Kutch, Rajasthan, and Sindh borders to check infiltration and trans-border crimes. They were, subsequently, deployed on the Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir following attacks launched by the Pakistani in",

Tên tuổi của ông cùng với người đương thời Claude Debussy thường được gắn liền với trường phái ấn tượng, mặc dù cả hai đều khước từ khái niệm này. Trong thập niên 1920 và 1930, Ravel được công nhận rộng rãi trên toàn thế giới là nhà soạn nhạc Pháp vĩ đại nhất còn sống. Ravel sinh ra trong một gia đình có truyền thống âm nhạc và theo học tại Nhạc viện Paris, trường âm nhạc hàng đầu của Pháp. Ông không được giới bảo thủ xem trọng tại cơ sở đào tạo này và việc họ đối xử bất công đối với ông về sau đã gây ra tai tiếng. Sau khi rời nhạc viện, Ravel tìm thấy con đường riêng của mình với tư cách là một nhà soạn nhạc; ông phát triển một phong cách rất đặc trưng và kết hợp vào âm nhạc của mình các yếu tố của chủ nghĩa hiện đại, baroque, tân cổ điển và trong những nhạc phẩm về sau là jazz.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Byzantine emperor from 962 to 1028 Constantine VIII Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans Contemporary miniature of Constantine VIII, from a Bari Exultet roll[1][2] Byzantine emperor Reign 15 December 1025 – 11 November 1028[n. 1] Coronation 30 March 962 Predecessor Basil II Successor Romanos III Born 960 Died 11/12 November 1028 (aged 67–68) Spouse Helena Issue Eudokia (bg) Zoe Theodora Dynasty Macedonian dynasty Father Romanos II Mother Theophano Constantine VIII (Greek: Κωνσταντῖνος, romanized: Kōnstantīnos;[n. 2] 960 – 11/12 November 1028) was de jure Byzantine emperor from 962 until his death. He was the younger son of Emperor Romanos II and Empress Theophano. He was nominal co-emperor from 962, successively with his father; stepfather, Nikephoros II Phokas; uncle, John I Tzimiskes; and brother, Basil II. Basil\u0027s death in 1025 left Constantine as the sole emperor. He occupied the throne for 66 years in total, making him de jure the longest-reigning amongst all Roman emperors since Augustus. Constantine displayed a lifelong lack of interest in politics, statecraft and the military, and during his brief sole reign the government of the Byzantine Empire suffered from mismanagement and neglect. He had no sons and was instead succeeded by Romanos Argyros, husband of his daughter Zoe. Family [edit] Constantine VIII\u0027s father (left) in the Romanos Ivory Constantine was born in 960, two years after his brother Basil. Their parents were Romanos II, the sixth Byzantine emperor of the Macedonian dynasty, and his second wife Theophano, an innkeeper\u0027s daughter described by contemporaries as ambitious and amoral.[3] Aged eight, Constantine was engaged to a daughter of Emperor Boris II of Bulgaria but in the end, he married a Byzantine aristocrat, Helena, daughter of Alypius. Of their three daughters, Eudokia (bg) became a nun after contracting smallpox, Zoe was empress for 22 years, and Theodora reigned for 18 months as the last monarch of the Macedonian line.[4] Life [edit] Gold solidus of Romanos II\u0027s father Constantine VII (left) and Romanos II (right), with a haloed Christ on reverse Histamenon of Nikephoros II (left) and Basil II (right) Histamenon of John Tzimiskes crowned by the Virgin Mary Childhood [edit] Romanos died suddenly in 963. Although Constantine was only three years old, he had already been crowned co-emperor in the preceding year, probably on 30 March.[1] The widowed Theophano installed herself as regent for her sons and stocked the imperial government with supporters, but she faced competition for power with Joseph Bringas, a former advisor of Romanos. Theophano allied with Nikephoros Phokas, a celebrated general and opponent of Bringas. In return for her hand, the childless Nikephoros gave his sacred pledge to protect her children and their interests. Three months after Romanos\u0027 death, supporters of Nikephoros ousted Bringas from power.[5] Nikephoros was crowned emperor in the presence of his nominal co-emperors, Constantine and Basil. A month later he married their mother.[6] Six years later, Nikephoros was murdered at Theophano\u0027s instigation and her lover and co-conspirator John Tzimiskes was acclaimed emperor. Fearing that the empress\u0027 many enemies would damage his political prospects, Tzimiskes turned against Theophano and sent her into exile. Constantine and Basil stayed in the capital and retained their status as co-emperors.[7][8] Adulthood [edit] Tzimiskes died in January 976, when Constantine was sixteen years old, and Basil and Constantine became the new heads of state. Nominally the brothers were equals, but Basil devoted himself to the responsibilities of his office and emerged as the senior Basileus.[9] Constantine had no comparable interest in state business, and never developed any.[10] Apart from participating in a military campaign in 989, which ended without any combat,[11] he occupied his years as Basil\u0027s colleague with private interests. In his youth Constantine was tall, graceful, and athletic, with an excellent speaking voice and a good grasp of rhetoric. He participated in wrestling competitions—which he brought back into fashion—and in the training and riding of horses. Alongside these active pursuits he was a gourmet and a gourmand,[12] leading in later years to chronic gout which impaired his ability to walk. Emperor [edit] Histamenon of Constantine VIII and Basil II Histamenon of Constantine VIII as sole emperor Basil II had an illustrious reign, pursuing both government reforms and a series of successful wars. He died childless on 15 December 1025 and Constantine, a sixty-five-year-old widower, became the sole emperor as Constantine VIII. During his long term as co-emperor, he had been content to enjoy the privileges of imperial status, without concerning himself with state affairs.[1] Sole rulership did not fundamentally alter this desire \"to pass his life wallowing in extravagant pleasures\".[13] Appointment of Alexi",

Починаючи з 1930-х років він побудував понад двадцять музичних інструментів, серед яких модифіковані альти, гітари, кіфари, маримби, фісгармонії, канони та багато інших. Музика Гаррі Парча написана в чистому строї, що походив зі Стародавньої Греції і вимагав настроювання інструментів «на слух». В XIX столітті в європейській музиці чистий стрій витіснила рівномірна темперація, що дозволяла грати на клавішних інструментах в будь-якій тональності. Натомість Парч вважав чистий стрій більш відповідним власним композиційним потребам. Він ділив октаву не на 12 півтонів, а на 43 нерівномірні інтервали натурального звукоряду, утворені основним тоном та його гармонічними обертонами. Більшість сучасних інструментів не підтримувала такий стрій, тож Парчу довелося будувати власні інструменти. Парч починав із невеликих композицій під акомпанемент поодиноких інструментів, та поступово перейшов до створення масштабних вистав, які називав «тотальним театром», що поєднували спів, танець, декламацію та гру на музичних інструментах.

The segment of I-10 in California, also known as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway,[4] runs east from Santa Monica through Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Palm Springs before crossing into the state of Arizona. In the Greater Los Angeles area, it is known as the Santa Monica and San Bernardino freeways, linked by a short concurrency on I-5 (Golden State Freeway) at the East Los Angeles Interchange. I-10 also has parts designated as the Rosa Parks and Sonny Bono Memorial freeways.[5] Some parts were also formerly designated as the Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway.[6] However, the California State Legislature removed this designation following the passage of a bill on August 31, 2022.[7][8] I-10 is also known colloquially as \"the 10\" to Southern California residents (See also California English § Freeways). Route description [edit] Time-lapse video of a trip on I-10 from Baldwin Park to its western terminus in Santa Monica I-10 is signed as if it begins at the McClure Tunnel in Santa Monica, although it legally begins farther east at the SR 1 interchange at Lincoln Boulevard.

Note the overhead sign which gives \"Indio [¶] Other Desert Cities\" as the control cities. I-10 eastbound near Indio The entirety of Interstate 10 in California is defined in section 310 of the California Streets and Highways Code as Route 10, and that the highway is from:[9] (a) Route 1 [State Route 1 (SR 1)] in Santa Monica to Route 5 [I-5] near Seventh Street in Los Angeles. (b) Route 101 [US Route 101 (US 101)] near Mission Road in Los Angeles to the Arizona state line at the Colorado River via the vicinity of Monterey Park, Pomona, Colton, Indio, and Chiriaco Summit and via Blythe. Because I-10 west of I-5 cannot access US 101, and I-10 east of I-5 cannot access US 101 southbound, signage instead directs motorists to the continuation of I-10 via I-5 between the East Los Angeles Interchange and the Santa Monica Freeway. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)\u0027s Interstate Highway route logs, along with most maps, also indicate that I-10 is cosigned along this segment,[1] despite the legal definition. The short unsigned section of Route 10 between Route 5 and Route 101, which was formerly defined as Route 110 (signed as I-110) until 1968, carries overhead signage for I-10 eastbound and for US 101 westbound. I-10 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System[10] and is part of the National Highway System,[11] a network of highways that are considered essential to the country\u0027s economy, defense, and mobility by the FHWA.[12] I-10 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System,[13] but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by Caltrans.[14] The Santa Monica Freeway is I-10 from SR 1 to I-5, as named",

Together, the Senate and House have the authority under Article One of the U.S. Constitution to make and pass or defeat federal legislation. The Senate has exclusive power to confirm U.S. presidential appointments, to approve or reject treaties, and to convict or exonerate impeachment cases brought by the House. The Senate and the House provide a check and balance on the powers of the executive and judicial branches of government. The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the U.S. Constitution, which has been in effect since March 4, 1789.[2] Each of the 50 states is represented by two senators who serve staggered six-year terms, for a total of 100 members.[3] From its inception in 1789 until 1913, senators were appointed by the state legislatures of their respective states. Since 1913, however, following ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment senators have been elected by statewide popular vote.[4] The Senate has several powers of advice and consent. These include the approval of treaties, the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries, federal judges (including justices of the Supreme Court), flag officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, other federal executive officials, and federal uniformed officers. If no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president, the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors to that office. The Senate conducts trials of officials who have been impeached by the House. The Senate has been considered both a more deliberative[5] and prestigious[6][7][8] body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere.[9] The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., the nation\u0027s capital. Despite not being a senator, the vice president of the United States serves as ex officio presiding officer and president of the Senate; the vice president may vote only if the Senate is equally divided. In the vice president\u0027s absence, the president pro tempore, who is traditionally the most senior member of the Senate majority party, presides over the Senate, and more often by rule allows a junior senator to take the chair, guided by the parliamentarian. In the early 1920s, the practice of majority and minority parties electing their floor leaders began. The Senate\u0027s legislative and executive business is managed and scheduled by the Senate majority leader, who, on occasion, negotiates some matters with the Senate minority leader. A characteristic practice in the Senate is the filibuster on some matters and its remedy the vote on cloture. History Main article: History of the United States Senate The drafters of the Constitution debated more about how to award representation in the Senate than about any other part of the Constitution.[10] While bicameralism and the idea of a proportional[d] \"people\u0027s house\" were widely popular, discussions about Senate representation proved contentious. In the end, some small states—unwilling to give up their equal power with larger states under the Articles of Confederation—threatened to secede[11] in 1787, and won the day by a vote of 5–4 in what became known as the Connecticut Compromise. The Connecticut Compromise provided, among other things, that each state—regardless of population—would be represented by two senators.[12] First convened in 1789, the Senate of the United States was formed on t",

It was gazetted on 13 November 1982.[12] History [edit] Originally known as Nerang Creek Heads,[13] it was named Southport because it was the southernmost port of the colony of Queensland.[1] A settlement was first surveyed in 1874 and the name Southport decided the following year.[1] Southport was once the site of timber mills. A port was established to ship logs to Brisbane. Cutting timber opened up the area for settlement. Early rural industries included sugar growing and livestock grazing. Southport Provisional School opened on 17 February 1880. On 1 July 1882, it became Southport State School.[14] Congregational Church, 1910 In 1879, the first Congregational services were held in Southport in the home of J. C. Lather conducted by the Reverend J. Whiting who ministered in the Logan and Albert River districts. Land was purchased in Queen Street and a Congregational church was opened there on 9 October 1880.[15] It was used for monthly Congregational services but was also available for use by other denominations. The first minister, Reverend A.R. Bailey was appointed in 1883. A manse was built in Bauer Street. J.B. Evans was the minister from late 1885, being replaced by J. G. Cribb in 1887. In 1888 a new Congregational Church was erected in White Street costing £530 and based on the designs prepared for the Milton Congregational Church in Brisbane. In 1899, the manse was relocated to behind the White Street church.[16] Kiosk and jetty at Southport in the early 1900s, the gates of the Star of the Star Convent are in the foreground. In 1883, the first Southport Pier was built to allow steamships to bring cargo and passengers to Southport.[17][18] In the 1880s, Southport became the chosen site for the holiday residence of the Queensland Governor Sir Anthony Musgrave and his wife Lady Musgrave. Known as the Summer Place and still situated on the present day site of The Southport School, the choice of Southport as the preferred holiday destination for one of the most prominent couples in Queensland established the township as Queensland\u0027s pre-eminent seaside resort.[19] Following the death of the governor in 1888, the Summer Place continued to be a holiday home for visitors to the area.[20][21] St Peters Church of England, 1900-1909 On Sunday 12 June 1887",

He then played five seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the World Football League (WFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes. Early life [edit] George Ignacio Mira was born in Key West, Florida, on January 11, 1942.[1] He was born to Jimmy Mira Sr. and Delores Mira.[2] Mira\u0027s father was a foreman at an ice supplier while his mother was a stay-at-home mom. Mira attended Key West High School, where he played basketball, baseball, and football. A pitcher in baseball, Mira led his high school teams to two state championships in 1958 and 1959.[3] He graduated from high school in 1960.[4] College career [edit] After high school, Mira joined the University of Miami to play college football under head coach Andy Gustafson in 1960.[5] He had received an offer of $20,000[a] to sign with the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball, but turned it down to finish college instead.[7] He was an immediate starter his freshman season, and set records for the University of Miami during his sophomore year.[8] Mira, nicknamed \"the Matador,\"[9] was well known for the \"fastball\" he would throw to receivers, influenced by his baseball prowess.[8][10] He was also known as a \"scrambler,\" frequently running on the field.[11] Bill Peterson of the Florida State Seminoles once said of Mira: \"He can throw, fake, and run. He keeps the pressure on you and he\u0027s the best I\u0027ve ever seen.\"[12] One of the best games in Mira\u0027s collegiate career came as a junior in 1962 in the Gotham Bowl against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Despite playing in 20 °F (−7 °C) weather in front of fewer than a thousand fans at Yankee Stadium, Mira threw for 321 yards, a Miami school record at the time, and was named the bowl game\u0027s most valuable player. Despite Mira\u0027s efforts, the Cornhuskers won by two points, 36–34.[13][14] The previous year, the Hurricanes lost by a single point to Syracuse in the Liberty Bowl,[15] in a game where Mira was reportedly recovering from a viral infection.[16] George Mira in a car in front of Key West City Hall with a sign that reads \u0027The Matador of Key West\u0027 in 1962. Mira was a sensation in Key West while he played for Miami. At one point, the city hosted a \"George Mira Day\" where they temporarily named a street in his honor.[2] At the start of the 1963 season Mira was the cover story for the college preview issue of Sports Illustrated. The article, written by Key West native John Underwood, was titled \"One Wonderful Conch is this Mira\" and featured many anecdotes about Mira\u0027s life growing up and becoming a star on the small island.[2][17] Professional career [edit] Mira was selected in the second round of the 1964 NFL draft, fifteenth overall, by the San Francisco 49ers. Primarily a reserve,[18] he played for eight NFL seasons, 1964 through 1971, for the 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, Baltimore Colts, and Miami Dolphins. He was a backup to John Brodie in San Francisco and to Bob Griese in Super Bowl VI as a member of the 1971 Dolphins.[19] With the 49ers in 1964, he threw a pass to quarterback Billy Kilmer (who was playing running back) that Kilmer eventually fumbled; the fumble would be recovered by Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall, who infamously ran 66 yards in the wrong direction.[20] Mira signed a multi-year contract with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in August 1972,[21][22] completing 92 of 168 passes for 1356 yards and 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 1973.[23] With the Birmingham Americans of the new World Football League ",

Established in 2008, it was preceded by several previous local government areas with histories extending back to the early 1900s and beyond. The main town of the region is Beaudesert. It has an estimated operating budget of A$33 million. In the 2021 census, the Scenic Rim Region had a population of 42,984 people.[1] History [edit] Prior to 2008, the new Scenic Rim Region was an entire area of three previous and distinct local government areas: the Shire of Boonah; the southern part of the Shire of Beaudesert; and the Harrisville and Peak Crossing areas from the City of Ipswich. Beaudesert Shire Tramway, 1903 A bullock team at Kalbar, 1915 Timber yards at Canungra, 1939 In July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released its report and recommended that the areas amalgamate. It identified a rural community of interest as well as ecotourism potential from the Scenic Rim, a group of mountain ranges forming part of the Great Dividing Range, and recommended the transfer of the entire urban growth corridor previously within Beaudesert to Logan City. Along with Lockyer Valley and Somerset, it was expected to provide a rural hinterland for urban South East Queensland. The arrangement was Boonah\u0027s second preference (its first was simply absorbing the rural areas of Ipswich) while Beaudesert opposed splitting or amalgamation.[3] The legislation passed to effect the merger on 10 August 2007. A Local Transition Committee made up of staff and councillors of the dissolving entities was formed to manage the process. On 15 March 2008, the Shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council. Geography [edit] Mount Lindesay from Palen Creek Mount Maroon, 2009 The region is mostly rural, with Beaudesert and Boonah the main towns. It lies within the catchment areas of the Bremer River, the Logan River/Albert River and the Coomera River/Nerang River. The centre of the area is dominated by the Flinders Peak Group and broad sweep of mountainous terrain forming a southern boundary with the local government area on Queensland\u0027s southern border with New South Wales. Many high-altitude areas are covered by forests and protected in national parks (including World Heritage listings) at Tamborine Mountain, McPherson Range, Main Range National Park, Mount Barney National Park and landforms including Cunninghams Gap and Fassifern Valley. South East Queensland\u0027s highest mountain is Mount Barney, reaching 1,356 metres (4,449 ft) above sea level. Wyaralong Dam is the region\u0027s newest reservoir. In the south east of the local government area is the Lamington National Park. It includes villages such as Canungra, Kooralbyn, Rathdowney, Beechmont and Harrisville. The peak at Mount French, part of Moogerah Peaks National Park is noted for its traditional rock climbing and does not have bolted climbing routes. The peak also boasts a \u002732\u0027 rated climb (one of the hardest in the world) which attracts international rock climbing visitors to the area. The area of Boonah is fairly flat with large areas of very productive soils for the growing of vegetables and other crops. Beechmont and O\u0027Reillys are mountainous areas overlooking the Gold Coast hinterland. These areas attract visitors for camping, bushwalking and bird watching. Council [edit] The council is split into six wards (divisions), each returning one councillor, along with a directly-elected mayor. Current composition [edit] The current council, elected in 2024, is: Ward Councillor Party Mayor Tom Sharp Independent Division 1 Amanda Hay Independent Division 2 Kerri Cryer Independent Division 3 Stephen Moriarty Independent Division 4 Jennifer Sanders Independent Division 5 Marshall Chalk Independent Division 6 Duncan McInnes Independent Mayors [edit] John Brent was the region\u0027s first mayor.

Pik, ruots. Pikis järnvägsstation) on rantaradalla Kaarinan kaupungin Piikkiön taajamassa sijaitseva rautatieliikennepaikka. Siihen aikaisemmin kuuluneen vuonna 1898 rakennetun asemarakennuksen on suunnitellut Bruno Granholm. Asema sijaitsee 10 kilometrin päässä Paimion rautatieasemalta ja 13 kilometrin päässä Kupittaan rautatieasemalta. Piikkiön rautatieasema avattiin yleiselle liikenteelle 1. marraskuuta 1899. Aseman toiminta kesti henkilöliikenteessä yli 80 vuotta, kunnes 25. toukokuuta 1979 henkilöliikenne asemalla lakkautettiin. Ratapihan kauko-ohjauksen valmistuttua vuonna 1995 asema muutettiin kokonaan miehittämättömäksi. Piikkiön rautatieasema on enää tavaraliikenteen käytössä (jonkin verran puunkuormausta) sekä junakohtauspaikkana. Rautatieliikenteen ohjaus hoidetaan keskitetysti Helsingin kautta. Säännöllistä henkilöliikennettä asemalla ei enää ole. Joulukuusta 2016 lähtien asemarakennus on ollut yksityisomistuksessa.

Since 2024, the championship has run from late November to early December. The event has been held at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey, England, every year since the inaugural edition in 2022. Following the collapse of the British Darts Organisation (BDO) in 2020, which hosted the BDO World Darts Championship at Lakeside from 1986 to 2019 and held the tournament\u0027s final edition in 2020, the WDF World Championship was established as the successor.[2] It is one of two World Championships in darts, along with the PDC World Darts Championship. Jimmy van Schie is the reigning WDF world champion, having defeated Mitchell Lawrie 6–3 in the 2025 final. Deta Hedman is the reigning women\u0027s world champion, Mitchell Lawrie is the reigning youth world champion, and Zehra Gemi is the reigning girls\u0027 world champion. Beau Greaves is the only player to win multiple WDF World Championships, winning the first three editions of the women\u0027s tournament. History [edit] The BDO World Darts Championship was a world championship in the sport of darts organised by the British Darts Organisation (BDO). The tournament was first held in 1978 and was the only form of the World Professional Darts Championship until the 1993 split in darts, when top players broke away from the BDO to set up the rival World Darts Council (WDC), now the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC), which began hosting its own World Championship.[3] The Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey, England, served as the host venue for the BDO tournament from 1986 to 2019, with the event being moved to the Indigo at The O2 for the 2020 event.[4] The 2020 event ended up being the last edition of the BDO World Championship, as the organisation went into liquidation in September 2020 following a series of financial issues relating to poor ticket sales and prize money.[5][6] Following the collapse of the BDO, the World Darts Federation (WDF), a darts tournament organiser and governing body,[7][8] announced its intention to launch its own World Championship.[9] Returning to the Lakeside Country Club and initially scheduled to take place in January 2022, the inaugural edition of the WDF World Championship took place in April 2022 after being postponed due to concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.[10][11] The event saw the introduction of a separate girls\u0027 tournament, which joined the men\u0027s tournament, women\u0027s tournament and boys\u0027 tournament in the schedule.[12] The PDC granted permission for its new Tour Card holders to compete at the WDF World Championship if they qualified for the tournament before the event\u0027s postponement.[13] At the event, Richard Veenstra produced the highest three-dart average in Lakeside history (104.91) in his 3–0 third-round victory over Luke Littler, breaking an 18-year record held by Raymond van Barneveld.[14] The WDF moved the World Championship to December for the 2023 edition, taking place right before the 2024 PDC World Championship. As a result, the PDC ruled against allowing players to compete in both events.[15] This rule prevented three-time women\u0027s world champion Beau Greaves from competing in the PDC World Championship, rejecting her place at the tournament in order to defend her world title at Lakeside in 2023 and 2024,[16] before she made a full switch to the PDC ahead of the 2026 PDC World Championship.[17] Since 2024, the WDF World Championship has run from late November to early December.[18] Tournament finals [edit] Open [edit] Jimmy van Schie, the reigning WDF world champion Neil Duff was the first WDF world champion, defeating Thibault Tricole in a deciding set in the 2022 final.[19] Andy Baetens won the tournament in 2023 by beating Chris Landman 6–1.[20] In 2024, 70-year-old Paul Lim, who hit the first world championship nine-dart finish at the 1990 BDO World Darts Championship, reached the final of the tournament, becoming the oldest player to reach a darts world championship final. He missed out on the title, losing 6–3 to Shane McGuirk.[21] In contrast, 15-year-old Mitchell Lawrie reached the final in 2025 to become the tournament\u0027s first teenage finalist. He lost to Jimmy van Schie by the same scoreline.[22] Duff, Baetens and McGuirk were the first senior world champions from Northern Ireland, Belgium and the Republic of Ireland respectively.[23][24][25] Year Champion (average in final)[b] Score Runner-up (aver",

Er ist mit einer Körperlänge von durchschnittlich 15 Zentimetern etwa so groß wie ein Haussperling, wirkt aber durch seine grazilere und schlankere Gestalt optisch größer als dieser. Der im Sommer in Mitteleuropa früher häufige, optisch unauffällige Vogel ist vor allem an Waldrändern und -lichtungen zu beobachten, da er als Bodenbrüter neben einem Bestand an hohen Bäumen und Sträuchern auch offene, mit hoher Vegetation bestandene Flächen benötigt. Er fällt dort vor allem durch seinen Gesang auf. Der Baumpieper ist ein Weitstreckenzieher, der in der Vegetationszone der Hochgras-Savannen West- und Ostafrikas überwintert. In Deutschland und der Schweiz steht der Baumpieper auf der Liste der bedrohten Singvögel und gilt auch in Kulturlandschaften als vom Aussterben bedroht. – Zum Artikel … Archiv Weitere exzellente und lesenswerte Artikel sowie informative Listen RSS-Feed Was geschah am 15.

The table below, however, excludes 16 Wikipedias that were closed and 11 of them were moved to the Wikimedia Incubator for further development, leaving a current total of 342 active Wikipedias. Content in other languages is being developed at the Wikimedia Incubator; languages which meet certain criteria can get their own wikis. The table entries are ordered by current article count. Each entry gives the language name in English (linked to the English Wikipedia article for the language); its \"local name\" (i.e. in the language itself); the language code used in the wiki\u0027s URL address and in interwiki links to it (linked to the local Main Page); and statistics on articles, edits, administrators, users, active users, and images (each linked to an appropriate local special page). To start a Wikipedia in a new language, please see our language proposal policy and the Incubator manual. Note: Just adding a link here does not create a new Wikipedia, nor does it serve to request that one be created. If a wiki becomes active and is not listed here, please post a notice on this article\u0027s talk page, including a link to all the relevant Wikipedia pages, and help promote the effort by announcing it on the Wikipedia-L mailing list, and at Wikimedia News. The tables here are maintained automatically based on statistics collected by a bot four times a day, so it is not necessary to \"manually\" update the table. (The way this is being done makes that impossible, anyway.) If something is wrong with an entry other than simply having slightly outdated statistics, post about it on the talk page. More lists of Wikipedias by various criteria : [ edit ] List of Wikipedias by article count, users, file count and depth and its source (both updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by edits per article and depth (both updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by language group and family (both updated every 6 hours) and language families as a tree (not just Wikipedias) List of Wikipedias by country (updated manually) List of Wikipedias by speakers per article (updated every 6 hours) List of Wikipedias by sample of articles and expanded sample of articles (both updated monthly) List of Wikipedias by featured and good articles (both updated manually) List of Wikipedias by creation date (incomplete) List of Wikipedias in multiple writing systems List of Wikipedias having local media files and zero local media files (both updated manually) List of Wikipedia milestones or en:Wikipedia:Milestone statistics (tracking of major article-count milestones) List of largest wikis (not just Wikimedia wikis) Wikimedia News (announcements and tracking of milestones for all Wikimedia projects) Tell us about your Wikipedia Notes The \"All pages\" column refers to the number of pages in all namespaces, including both articles (the official article count of each wiki) and non-articles (user pages, images, talk pages, \"project\" pages, categories, and templates). \"Active Users\" are registered users who have made at least one edit in the last thirty days. \"Files\" is the number of locally uploaded files. Note that some large Wikipedias do not use local images or other media files and rely on Commons completely, so the value \"0\" is not a glitch (see also List of Wikipedias having zero local media files). All Wikipedias ordered by number of articles The languages listed here are Wikipedias that have been created as separate subdomains of wikipedia.org, ordered by number of articles. The table can also be sorted by other columns. It excludes closed Wikipedias. Historical data of this table dating back to 2007 can be found in the history of this table or, after 15 October 2022, in the history of the current source of the data.

Музей римской цивилизации Библиотеки в Древнем Риме появились относительно поздно, примерно ко II веку до н. э. Римское государство, в отличие от древнегреческих и эллинистических правительств, не интересовалось системой образования и накопления книг. Первые библиотеки в Риме были частными, их фонды составлялись из греческих книг, захваченных во время завоеваний. Только на рубеже новой эры императоры стали заботиться о библиотеках, финансировать их создание и копирование книг. Античные библиотеки представляли собой статусные учреждения, в которых хранились канонические наборы текстов, упоминаемые в источниках как военная добыча и предмет гордости правителей или частных владельцев. В ареале греческой культуры — с центрами в Афинах и Александрии — именно правитель (демократически избранный архонт, тиран или царь) осуществлял накопление эталонных литературных текстов, передаваемых от поколения к поколению. Даже глава философской школы ассоциировался с политической властью. Данную концепцию попытался воссоздать в Риме Юлий Цезарь, но неудачно. Создаваемые от времени Августа публичные библиотеки имели статус собственности римского народа и, по-видимому, предназначались не столько для сохранения и передачи письменных текстов, сколько для декламации общественно значимых и одобряемых императорами произведений. Предположительно все императорские библиотеки финансировались из фиска или эрария. В символическом смысле библиотеки выражали заботу императорской власти о высокой культуре (пайдейе), позволяя заявлять о Риме как центре цивилизации. Книжная культура Рима достаточно хорошо известна из литературных источников золотого века латинской литературы, сохранилась и единственная целостная библиотека того времени — на вилле Папирусов в Геркулануме. В I—III веках в Риме насчитывалось семь или девять библиотек, связанных с крупнейшими храмами и общественными пространствами, как минимум две из них включали секции латинской и греческой литературы. Согласно археологическим данным, фонды крупнейших библиотек могли составлять около 20 тысяч папирусных свитков.

Ταυρικὦν κλίματα)) — одно из названий исторического региона на юго-западе горного Крыма, либо его структурных подразделений, населённых, преимущественно готами. Климаты, как административные районы, управлялись топархами, которых иногда называли архонтами. Собственно климатами в Византийской империи называли самую мелкую административную единицу (нижнего уровня) в пограничных провинциях, управлявшуюся архонтами, потому к ним иногда применяли термин «архонтство». В случае средневековой Таврики топоним климаты, в разное время с различными уточнениями, применяли как синоним административной единицы верхнего уровня. С VII века это была область Дори — здесь локализовали Климаты Херсона. С VIII века и, возможно, до первой половины XIII века вместо Дори фигурировала Готия, или «Климаты Готии». Со второй половины VIII века и по 841 год Климаты находились под властью Хазарского каганата, сохранившего в них византийскую административную структуру. В 841 году Византия восстановила своё владычество, учредив в Таврике «фему пяти Климатов». В византийских документах название употреблялось до X века, в исторической литературе — до XIII века. Считается, что регион граничил с владениями Херсонеса, иногда юридически объединяясь в одну административную единицу. Некоторыми историками выдвигались версии о распространении понятия Климаты практически на весь горный Крым и крымскую часть Боспора, что противоречит прямым указаниям в имеющихся документах.

Le cheval Castillonnais, ou cheval de Castillon, est une race de petits chevaux de selle montagnards et rustiques d\u0027origine française. Connu et décrit au début du XXe siècle, ce petit cheval a failli disparaître en parallèle de l\u0027adoption croissante de la motorisation, entre autres par le croisement avec des chevaux de trait. Il est sauvegardé de justesse par quelques éleveurs durant les années 1980 et 1990. Reconnu par les Haras nationaux en 1996, il reste à faible effectifs. Une association d\u0027éleveurs et le haras national de Tarbes se mobilisent pour sauvegarder et préserver cette race. De robe bai-brun ou bai foncé, il est très proche du Mérens avec lequel il partage de nombreuses caractéristiques, mais nettement moins connu. C\u0027est un bon cheval de loisir qui peut être monté en randonnée et attelé avec succès. Il vit principalement à l\u0027extrémité sud-ouest de l\u0027Ariège, dans les Pyrénées, dans un terroir éponyme caractérisé par la vallée du Lez, près de Saint-Girons. Son élevage s\u0027est étendu à d\u0027autres régions de France, notamment en Haute-Saône.

Vetrina Il teatro dell\u0027Artico della seconda guerra mondiale, parte del più vasto teatro scandinavo del secondo conflitto mondiale, vide contrapporsi da una parte le forze della Germania e della Finlandia (quest\u0027ultima fino all\u0027armistizio del 19 settembre 1944), e dall\u0027altra le forze degli Alleati, e in particolar modo quelle di Regno Unito, Unione Sovietica, Norvegia e Stati Uniti d\u0027America; le operazioni militari svoltesi al di sopra del circolo polare artico compresero attività terrestri, navali ed aeree. Le operazioni terrestri videro, nell\u0027aprile del 1940, le forze tedesche impossessarsi con un\u0027operazione anfibia dell\u0027importante porto norvegese di Narvik, affrontando poi con successo il contrattacco di un corpo di spedizione anglo-francese. Successivamente, a seguito dell\u0027avvio dell\u0027operazione Barbarossa nel giugno del 1941, truppe tedesche e finlandesi aprirono un fronte di guerra nel nord della Lapponia, puntando alla conquista dello strategico porto sovietico di Murmansk; dopo l\u0027abbandono dell\u0027alleanza con i tedeschi nel settembre del 1944, i finlandesi cooperarono coi sovietici per cacciare i reparti della Wehrmacht dalla Lapponia e dal nord della Norvegia. Contemporaneamente, unità speciali britanniche, appartenenti al corpo dei British Commandos, condussero una serie di incursioni contro le installazioni tedesche in Norvegia, mentre scontri minori e azioni su piccola scala finirono per interessare anche territori remoti come le isole Svalbard o la costa orientale della Groenlandia. A dispetto del clima ostile, le acque dell\u0027artico videro un\u0027intensa attività aeronavale durante quasi tutto l\u0027arco del conflitto: in particolare, la Kriegsmarine da un lato e la Royal Navy e le marine militari alleate (soprattutto la Flotta del Nord sovietica, la United States Navy e la Royal Canadian Navy) dall\u0027altro, supportate dalle rispettive forze aeree, ingaggiarono una serrata lotta lungo la rotta tra l\u0027Islanda e Murmansk, utilizzata dagli Alleati per far giungere in URSS massicci quantitativi di armi e materiale bellico ceduti ai sovietici nell\u0027ambito degli accordi Lend-Lease; ripetute furono anche le incursioni dei gruppi navali e delle forze aeree anglo-statunitensi contro le basi navali tedesche nel nord della Norvegia, volte alla caccia e alla distruzione delle principali unità da battaglia della Kriegsmarine.

Di piccole dimensioni, il carapace raggiunge solitamente una lunghezza compresa tra i 13 e i 16 cm. Il suo areale è compreso nel centro-sud degli Stati Uniti, dove, nonostante alcune minacce derivate dalle attività antropica, è classificata come una specie a basso rischio. In virtù delle piccole dimensioni, questo rettile è spesso venduto e allevato come animale da compagnia.

Han solodebuterede med hitsinglen \"Engel\" i 2009 efter at have fungeret som sangskriver for andre musikere i mere end ti år. I september fulgte hans selvbetitlede debutalbum, der blev en stor succes med over 240.000 solgte eksemplarer, samt rekorden for flest uger på toppen af album-hitlisten. Med udsendelsen af sit andet album, Mer\u0027 end kærlighed, i oktober 2011 blev Seebach den hurtigst sælgende musiker i Danmark nogensinde, da albummet solgte over 42.000 eksemplarer på én uge. Samlet set har Seebach solgt over 600.000 eksemplarer af sine to første album sammen med live-albummet Rasmus Seebach Live (2012). Han har siden udgivet albummene Ingen kan love dig i morgen (2013) og Verden kan vente (2015). Seebachs musik er blevet udgivet i Sverige, Norge og Tyskland. I Sverige og Norge har han haft succes med top fem-hittet \"Natteravn\", der solgte henholdsvis guld og tredobbelt platin. I Danmark har Seebach, sammen med storebroren Nicolai, haft stor succes som sangskriver med støttesangen \"Hvor små vi er\" (2005), der solgte 13 gange platin. Seebachs succes som solomusiker er blevet tilskrevet sangenes enkle, banale tekster om \"kærlighed og byture, der i sin lyrik oftest er tale- eller SMS-sprog\", samt \"at hans livshistorie indeholder ingredienserne til en dansk pop-fortælling af de mere barske\", med henvisning til at Seebach er søn af den populære dansktopsanger Tommy Seebach, der døde af et hjertestop i 2003 efter et årelangt alkoholmisbrug.

Seneste tre uger: Lars von Trier — Juletraditioner — Jul Mere om Ugens artikel • Arkiv Dagens skandinaviske artikel Gjesvål eller Gisvold er en gård på Fannrem, omtrent 50 km sørvest for Trondheim. Gården har lang historie. Gårdsanlegget ligger omkring 150 meter øst for Orkdal kirke, på samme platå som denne og prestegården, og det kan ha vært bebyggelse og bosetning på platået langt tilbake i førkristen tid. Gjesvål har tilhørt erkebispesetet i Nidaros. Etter reformasjonen ble gården krongods, og fra 1600-tallet har den blant annet vært fogd-, kapellan- og lensmannsgård. Sagbruksdrift har i perioder, fra 1600-tallet og fremover, vært viktig for Gjesvål. Hovedbygningen fra 1773, med det spesielle seteritaket, er fredet. Bygningen har mange trekk til felles med trepaleene og lystgårdene i Trondheim, og det er mulig at både arkitekt og bygningsarbeidere ble hentet derfra. ► Les mer her.

The well-known catchphrase was a line from the first installment, in which Marisol sobs, \"I love you, but not enough to die for you\". The story follows a young Hispanic couple as they explore human sexuality and the effects of the AIDS epidemic on their relationship. Designed to appeal to a Hispanic audience particularly at risk due to cultural attitudes discouraging condom use, it has been described as \"one part steamy soap opera, one part language instruction, and two parts AIDS education service\". The ads were praised by public health officials for presenting situations which people could relate to, and by AIDS activists for breaking down the social stigma associated with the disease. They drew criticism, however, from family values advocates who objected to the promotion of condoms and the tacit acceptance of homosexuality. (Full article...)

Named after the Prussian province of Pomerania, she was laid down on 22 March 1904, launched on 2 December 1905, and commissioned into the navy on 6 August 1907. The ship was armed with four 28 cm (11 in) guns and had a top speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). Pommern was assigned to II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. At the start of World War I, she was stationed at the Elbe to support the defenses of the German Bight. She participated in sorties into the North Sea in attempts to destroy portions of the British Grand Fleet. These offensive operations culminated in the Battle of Jutland, where she was hit by torpedoes, which detonated one of her 17-centimeter (6.7 in) gun magazines. The resulting explosion broke the ship in half and killed the entire crew. (This article is part of a featured topic: Battleships of Germany.) Recently featured: Julio and Marisol Mechanical Turk KEXP-FM Archive By email More featured articles About view talk edit history watch December 3 Ovalipes catharus, commonly known as the paddle crab, swimming crab, or pāpaka in Māori, is a species of crab found in shallow, sandy-bottomed waters around the coasts of New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, and uncommonly in southern Australia. This species is an opportunistic, aggressive, and versatile feeder active mostly at night, preying predominantly on molluscs and crustaceans. It is also highly prone to cannibalism, which accounts for over a quarter of its diet in some locations. The crab\u0027s paddle-shaped rear legs and streamlined carapace allow it to capture prey by swimming rapidly and to escape predation by burrowing in the sand. Its mating season is in winter and spring, after which the female likely moves into deeper waters to incubate and disperse her larvae. Commercial fisheries have harvested paddle crabs since the 1970s, and O. catharus is present in Māori culture as both an artistic motif and as a traditional source of food. (Full article...)

Summary DescriptionWellcome Collection Rocking Bed.jpg English: Patients with breathing difficulties were treated using this rocking bed. It was invented by Dr Jessie Wright (1900-70) in the mid-1940s. She was an English doctor living in the US. The first rocking beds were used by patients who had experienced polio, which can paralyse the chest muscles. This leaves the patient unable to breath for themselves. ; This example was made by the Cape Engineering Co. Ltd based in Warwick, England. The patient lies on the bed and is slowly rocked horizontally, like a seesaw. When the patient’s head is raised, the diaphragm is pulled down by gravity. This draws air into the lungs. When the patient’s feet are raised, air is forced out of the lungs. The speed of the rocking bed was adjusted depending on how much help a person needed to breathe. Rocking beds could be used with patients who were not completely dependent on an iron lung. They gave patients greater freedom of movement instead of being almost completely encased. Rocking beds are still used to assist breathing for numerous medical complaints.

At first a supporter of James Buchanan, whom he succeeded in the Senate when Buchanan became Secretary of State in 1845, Cameron broke with Buchanan and the Democrats by the 1850s. An opponent of slavery, he briefly joined the Know Nothings before winning another term in the Senate as a Republican in 1857. He helped nominate and elect Lincoln, but rumors of corruption surrounded him; it was with reluctance that Lincoln appointed him to the cabinet. He did not do well in his post, and Lincoln made him minister to Russia in 1862, a post he held briefly. He rebuilt his political machine in Pennsylvania, winning a third term in the Senate in 1867. After ten years he resigned, arranging the election of his son, Don Cameron, in his place. Simon Cameron lived to age 90; his machine dominated local politics until the 1920s. (Full article...)

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Chilean politician (1937–2025) Pablo Rodríguez Grez Leader of Fatherland and Liberty Nationalist Front In office 1 April 1971 – 13 September 1973 Preceded by Created movement Succeeded by Dissolved movement Personal details Born (1937-12-20)20 December 1937 Santiago, Chile Died 9 December 2025(2025-12-09) (aged 87) Party National Advance Other political affiliations National Action Movement (1983–1987) Fatherland and Liberty (1971–1973) Pablo Rodríguez Grez[a] (20 December 1937 – 9 December 2025) was a Chilean politician and lawyer. He supported and was a lawyer for Augusto Pinochet. Rodríguez became known for his authoritarian ideals and for founding the Fatherland and Liberty movement, in which he had been accused of terrorist acts, in addition to collaborating with Pinochet\u0027s coup in 1973. He was also a candidate for the National Advance party for the presidency of Chile in 1989. Rodríguez was a lecturer in civil law at the University of Chile\u0027s faculty of law from 1978 and was a partner at the law firm Rodríguez Vergara y Compañía. Early life [edit] Rodríguez was born on 20 December 1937, in the capital Santiago. In 1956, his father, Manuel Rodríguez Valenzuela (es), a former education minister, killed himself after an investigation by the comptroller general.[1] He graduated in legal and social sciences in 1960 from the faculty of law at the University of Chile, then received his law degree in 1962.[2][3] He also received the Pedro Nicolás Montenegro award in 1960.[4] Political life [edit] Rodríguez was a strong opponent of Salvador Allende. In 1970, alongside right-wing youth figures such as Jaime Guzmán, he founded the Comité Cívico Patria y Libertad, a committee designed to prevent Allende\u0027s election. Some of the committee\u0027s ideals, such as anti-communism and opposition to the UP, served as inspiration for the Fatherland and Liberty party.[5][6] These groups generally had nationalist ideals and connections to the armed forces, such as the Juventud Anticomunista de Chile.[7] Fatherland and Liberty [edit] Rodríguez founded the Fatherland and Liberty party on 1 April 1971, at an event at the stadium Nathaniel in the heart of the capital, later becoming head.[8] It emerged as an opposition to the government of Salvador Allende and which had supposed support from the CIA.[9] He preached nationalist and fascist ideals (especially Italian fascism) and that Congress, along with the country\u0027s traditional parties, were responsible for the economic crisis.[10] The movement did not have many members, but it had some power in politics. The movement carried out terrorist acts and sabotage against the Allende government, such as the murder of Arturo Araya Peeters (es).[11] They attempted a strike in 1972, but failed. The movement had contact with Armored Regiments (Nº2), in which they attempted a coup in June 1973, with tanks in the streets and bomb attacks, in which it became known as “Tanquetazo”, which was also unsuccessful.[5][12][13] After the failed coup attempt, he and other officials sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy: he lived in Quito for two months before returning to Chile clandestinely from Argentina.[14][15] Military dictatorship [edit] Rodríguez dissolved the movement after Pinochet\u0027s coup in 1973. He tried to gain Pinochet\u0027s trust, even though he disagreed with the economic policy adopted, which was liberal and he was corporatist.[16] Pinochet ignored much of Rodríguez\u0027s advice and did not have much influence on the regime, even though he played a leading role in the coup that toppled Allende. He advised Pinochet not to respect the courts and crack down on Christian Democracy, saying that his supporters wanted the Junta Militar to fail and that the University of Chile became an \"umbrella for Christian Democracy.\" He expressed his loyalty to the regime after saying: \"I am the most modest soldier, the most humble, but the most loyal to this cause\" and that: \"our position is one of absolute and unconditional support for the government\".[17] In 1983, Rodríguez, Federico Willoughby-MacDonald (es) and Gastón Acuña founded the National Action Movement (es) (MAN), after the political opening in 1983 by minister Sergio Onofre Jarpa. In 1987, the MAN disbanded after leader Willoughby-MacDonald left the party.[18] 1989 presidential candidate [edit] Between 1988 and 1989 he tried to be a candidate for the presidency in the presidential elections by National Advance, in which he hoped to receive the support of the government, but he failed after the lack of support from sectors of the right (especially UDI and RN) and the government, in which he supported the candidacy of Hernán Büchi.[19] After Patricio Aylwin\u0027s victory in the 1989 election, Pinochet called an urgent meeting in La Moneda with various officials, including Rodríguez. He showed Pinochet a typewriter and stated that he could write a letter to render Aylwin\u0027s election null and void. Pinoche",

Imaju distinktivan površinski uzorak traka ili točaka koje se može osjetiti pomoću bijelog štapa ili stopalom. Cilj im je voditi slabovidne osobe kroz prostor te ih upozoriti na nadolazeće puteve, prometnice ili ulice, kao i na potencijalno opasne promjene u površini ili nagibu tla. Prvi sustav taktilnih staza uveden je na pješačkim prijelazima i drugim opasnim prilazima cestama u Japanu 1960-ih. Ujedinjeno Kraljevstvo, Australija i SAD usvojili su standard 1990-ih godina. U Hrvatskoj su zakonski usvojene 2005. godine. Taktilne staze često se pogrešno percipiraju kao staze za bicikle ili romobile.

Kao spin-off serije Age of Empires, Age of Mythology crpi dio inspiracije iz mitologije i legendi Grka, Egipćana i Nordijaca, a ne iz stvarnih historijskih događaja. Mnogi elementi igranja slični su serijalu Age of Empires, dok mitološka stvorenja i natprirodne moći igranje podižu izvan područja realizma. Kampanja prati atlantskog admirala Arkantosa, koji je prisiljen putovati kroz zemlje tri kulture u igri, loveći kiklopa koji je u savezu s Posejdonom protiv Atlantide. Age of Mythology bila je komercijalno uspješna igra, dostigavši platinasti tiraž četiri mjeseca nakon izlaska i prodavši preko milion primjeraka. Godine 2003. uslijedio je ekspanzijski paket, Age of Mythology: The Titans. Adaptacija u vidu društvene igre pod nazivom Age of Mythology: The Boardgame, objavljena je 2003. godine od strane firme Eagle Games. Dana 8. maja 2014. godine, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition je objavljen za Windows putem Steama. Nakon toga uslijedio je drugi ekspanzijski paket, Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon, objavljen 28. januara 2016. godine. Dana 4. septembra 2024. godine, objavljen je remaster, Age of Mythology: Retold.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Mechanical respirator Rocking bed An example of a rocking bed Industry Medical Application Treatment of polio Inventor Frank Cecil Eve C. E. Sanders Charlotte Baron Jessie Wright Invented 1931 1944 (for polio) The rocking bed is a device that was used as a method of treatment for poliomyelitis as an alternate method to the iron lung of artificial respiration. History [edit] A newspaper illustration showing a rocking bed In 1931, Frank Cecil Eve experimented with a rocking stretcher as a means of artificial respiration. Through tilting between 30° and 45° at a rate aligned with natural breathing, Eve reported that respiration was maintained for several days.[1] In 1936 Sanders began using this bed to treat vascular disease.[2][3] Treatment for polio [edit] In 1944, Jessie Wright, an English-born doctor in Pittsburgh, began experimenting with the Sanders bed to treat polio.[2][1] Charlotte M. Baron, a public health nurse, oversaw the designing of the bed and by September 1946 trials were being conducted.[3][4][5] By means of the rocking bed, patients were able to be outside of the iron lung for increasing periods of time, gradually progressing towards self-sustaining respiration.[4] A cuirass attached to a pump would create negative pressure to further increase respiratory activity.[2] By 1951, the ability of rocking beds to quicken the weaning process from the iron lung had been noted.[6] Some doctors believed that early treatment of polio could result in only usage of the rocking bed being required, and not the iron lung.[7] However, research indicated that early-stage polio could be treated well by the bed, but those in an acute stage were unable to have their needs met.[8] By 1951, over 200 rocking beds were in hospitals,[9] and by 1964, the American Journal of Nursing reported that of some 1,612 people experiencing some degree of paralysis from polio in the United States, 334 were using iron lungs and 677 were using rocking beds.[10] References [edit] ^ a b Dail, C.

At first a supporter of James Buchanan, whom he succeeded in the Senate when Buchanan became Secretary of State in 1845, Cameron broke with Buchanan and the Democrats by the 1850s. An opponent of slavery, he briefly joined the Know Nothings before winning another term in the Senate as a Republican in 1857. He helped nominate and elect Lincoln, but rumors of corruption surrounded him; it was with reluctance that Lincoln appointed him to the cabinet. He did not do well in his post, and Lincoln made him minister to Russia in 1862, a post he held briefly. He rebuilt his political machine in Pennsylvania, winning a third term in the Senate in 1867. After ten years he resigned, arranging the election of his son, Don Cameron, in his place. Simon Cameron lived to age 90; his machine dominated local politics until the 1920s. (Full article...)

He played quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons, primarily with the New England Patriots. Over the course of his career, he played in 55 games, with 7 starts, for the Patriots and Miami Dolphins, completed 124 of 248 passes for 1,314 yards, threw eight touchdowns and seven interceptions, and finished his career with a passer rating of 64.8. A graduate of Ringgold High School and the University of Maryland, Zolak was selected 84th in the 1991 NFL draft by the New England Patriots. He did not play in 1991, but started four games in 1992 and had his most productive season statistically. When Drew Bledsoe was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup for the next six seasons. He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when he was hurt, but only started three games during this time. He was released at the end of the 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring. After his retirement, he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area. Early life [edit] High school [edit] Zolak was born on December 13, 1967, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a child, was the waterboy for the football team at Ringgold High School in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, where his father, Paul, worked as head coach and athletic director.[1][2][3] Future NFL quarterback Joe Montana played for Ringgold during this time and gave Zolak a football, which he later rubbed for good luck before every game.[1] When Zolak attended Ringgold High School himself, he was the team\u0027s starting quarterback and punter, and lettered four times.[2] Zolak also played on the Ringgold basketball team as a forward, and was a four-time letterman in that sport as well.[2] As a result of his football performance, he was invited to participate in the Big 33 Football Classic, which featured the top high school football players in Pennsylvania.[4] College [edit] After graduating from high school, Zolak played college football at the University of Maryland. He sat out his freshman year, and became the third-string quarterback for the Terrapins behind Dan Henning and Neil O\u0027Donnell after two quarterbacks transferred.[5] By the end of his sophomore season, Zolak was challenging O\u0027Donnell for the starting job after Henning graduated.[6] As his junior year began, in the summer of 1988, offensive coordinator Bob Valesente said that Zolak was making tremendous strides as a quarterback, but O\u0027Donnell was the starting quarterback that year.[7] Zolak\u0027s first collegiate appearance came against West Virginia. He completed four of six passes for 28 yards, but had an interception returned for a touchdown by Bo Orlando in a 55–24 loss.[8] He appeared in four games for Maryland that season.[2] Zolak was again the backup behind O\u0027Donnell in 1989. He played in eight games, completing 33 of 69 passes for 407 yards and two touchdowns.[2] In 1990, after O\u0027Donnell graduated and began his NFL career, Zolak became the starter for Maryland, and head coach Joe Krivak had high hopes for him heading into the season.[9] In his first start as a senior, Zolak completed a school-record 28 passes in 46 attempts for 303 yards and two touchdowns, including a 51-yard pass to Gene Thomas with 61 seconds left that gave Maryland the win against Virginia Tech, 20–13.[10] The following week, he once more featured in a dramatic conclusion, throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Gene Thomas with 2:27 left to beat 25th-ranked West Virginia, 14–10.[11] However, he was struggling in other aspects of his game. In an October game against Georgia Tech, Zolak was sacked 10 times. In four games, he had been sacked 23 times and had 12 passes intercepted.[12] By the end of the season, as Maryland was preparing to face Louisiana Tech in the 1990 Independence Bowl, he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2,589 yards and 10 touchdowns.[13] The teams tied, 34–34, in Zolak\u0027s final collegiate appearance. At the time of his graduation, he ranked fifth in school history with 270 pass completions, seventh with 3,124 career passing yards, and second with 2,589 passing yards in a season. He was also named Atlantic Coa",

Jiné jazyky Embassy Článek týdne Lord Kelvin kolem roku 1900 William Thomson (26. června 1824 Belfast – 17. prosince 1907 Netherhall u Largsu, Skotsko), známý spíše jako lord Kelvin z Largsu, byl britský matematik, matematický fyzik, inženýr a vynálezce. Po dlouhých 53 let byl profesorem přírodní filozofie na Glasgowské univerzitě, kde se zabýval matematickou analýzou elektřiny, formuloval první a druhý termodynamický zákon a velmi se zasloužil o rozvoj vznikajícího oboru fyziky. Byl zvolen prezidentem Královské společnosti a jako první britský vědec byl povýšen do Sněmovny lordů. Během svého života sestrojil řadu vynálezů, např. kvadrantový elektroměr, přístroje pro měření elektřiny v atmosféře nebo nový typ buzoly. Je po něm pojmenována jednotka termodynamické teploty kelvin (K), což je jedna ze sedmi základních jednotek soustavy SI. Ačkoli existence absolutní nuly byla známa již od roku 1702, kdy ji navrhl Guillaume Amontons, Thomson určil roku 1848 její přesnou hodnotu jako −273,15 °C. V letech 1857–1866 se osobně podílel na kladení transatlantických podmořských kabelů, za což byl královnou Viktorií pasován na rytíře. Je po něm rovněž pojmenován Joulův–Thomsonův jev, Thomsonův jev, Kelvinova–Helmholtzova nestabilita a Kelvinovy mořské a atmosférické vlny. Byl pohřben ve Westminsterském opatství v Londýně vedle ostatků Isaaka Newtona.

See on raske, värvitu ja lõhnatu väärisgaas, üks õhu üliväikese kontsentratsiooniga komponente. Looduses esinev ksenoon koosneb 8 stabiilsest isotoobist. Lisaks on sellel üle 40 mittestabiilse radioaktiivse isotoobi. Ksenooni stabiilsed isotoobid on olulised abivahendid Päikesesüsteemi varase ajaloo uurimisel. Radioaktiivne isotoop ksenoon-135 tekib tuumareaktsioonis isotoobist jood-135 ja see on oluline neutronkiirguse neelaja tuumareaktorites. Ksenoon tahkub temperatuuril −111,75 °C ja kondenseerub temperatuuril −108,099 °C. Ksenooni kasutatakse ksenoonvälklampides, ksenoonkaarlampides ja üldanesteesias. Esimeses eksimeerlaseris kasutati ksenooni dimeermolekuli (Xe2) töötava ainena ja paljudes varastes laserites täitsid pumpade ülesannet ksenoonvälklambid. Samuti kasutatakse ksenooni tumeaine uuringutes hüpoteetiliste nõrgalt vastastikmõjustuvate osakeste otsingutel ja kosmonautikas ioonmootorite kütusena. Loe edasi ... Arhiiv Kas teadsid?

Ho sat som vald medlem av Venezuelas nasjonalforsamling frå 2011 til 2014. Machado var kandidat i presidentvalet i Venezuela i 2012, men tapte opposisjonsnominasjonen mot Henrique Capriles. Under protestane i Venezuela i 2014 var ho ein av hovudfigurane bak organiseringa av demonstrasjonane mot Maduro-regimet. Ho var førehandskandidat for Vente Venezuela i primærvala til Den einskaplege plattforma i 2023, men vart den 30. juni 2023 frådømd retten til å stille til val i 15 år av Riksrevisjonen i Venezuela. I 2025 vart Machado tildelt Nobels fredspris «for det utrettelege arbeidet sitt for å fremje demokratiske rettar for det venezuelanske folket og for kampen sin for ei rettferdig og fredeleg overgang frå diktatur til demokrati». Ho vart kåra til ei av BBC sine «100 Women» i 2018, og var på lista over Time Magazine sine 100 mest innverknadsrike personar i 2025. I 2024 mottok Machado Václav Havel-prisen for menneskerettar og Sakharovprisen (delt med González), for å representere venezuelanarar i kampen for demokrati.

She succeeded Ummy Mwalimu whose tenure in the role lasted 14 years. Mhagama was a politician belonging to the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, and had previously been a Member of Parliament for Peramiho constituency. In December 2015, she was appointed a Minister of State in the Prime Minister\u0027s Office responsible for Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled in President John Magufuli\u0027s administration. In January 2022, she was moved to the President’s Office Good Governance and Public Services.[1] Early life and education [edit] Mhagama was born on 23 June 1967. She completed her schooling from Peramiho Girls\u0027 Secondary School in 1986. In 1989, she received her Diploma in Education from the Korogwe Teachers Training College. She worked as a teacher for six years between 1991 and 1997.[2] Political career [edit] Mhagama first became involved with CCM in 1987 and served in a variety of roles including in the youth and women wings of the party. She was first appointed to the Parliament from a special seat reserved for women in 2000.[2] In 2005, she defeated former Finance Minister Simon Mbilinyi in a primary for the right to represent CCM in the upcoming elections for Peramiho constituency in Ruvuma Region.[3] An analysis found that Mhagama was the second most active MP in the 2005-2010 Parliament in terms of contributions to debates and questions to ministers.[4] Mhagama was the Deputy Minister for Education and Vocational Training in President Jakaya Kikwete\u0027s administration between January 2014 and January 2015. Then in a cabinet reshuffle, she was promoted and named Minister of State in the Prime Minister\u0027s Office for Policy, coordination and parliamentary affairs.[5] In the 2015 general elections, Mhagama won her Peramiho seat against CHADEMA candidate Erasmo Mwingira by a vote margin of 32,057 votes to 11,462.[6] In the new President John Magufuli\u0027s cabinet, she was appointed a Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office for Labour, Employment, Youth and People with Physical Disabilities.[7] In January 2022, she was moved to the President’s Office Good Governance and Public Services. Mhagama was sworn in as Tanzania\u0027s Minister of Health on 15 August 2024 by President Samia Suluhu Hassan.[8] Death [edit] Jenista Mhagama died in Dodoma, Tanzania on 11 December 2025, at the age of 58.[9] After funeral services in Dodoma and Peramiho, her burial was scheduled to be held on 16 December in Ruanda Village in Mbinga District.[10] References [edit] ^ Owere, Paul; Wambura, Bethsheba (8 January 2022). \"President Samia rings changes in cabinet\".

Han räknas som en av Latinamerikas ledande romanförfattare och essäister. Han är en av de mest inflytelserika bland de författare som slog igenom under den latinamerikanska boomen under 1960- och 1970-talen. Vargas Llosa genombrott kom på 1960-talet med romanerna Staden och hundarna och Det gröna huset, där han skildrar och riktar kritik mot det peruanska samhället. Flera av hans böcker, bland andra Tant Julia och författaren och Pantaleón och soldatbordellen, har filmatiserats och hans böcker har varit internationellt framgångsrika.

Tên tuổi của ông cùng với người đương thời Claude Debussy thường được gắn liền với trường phái ấn tượng, mặc dù cả hai đều khước từ khái niệm này. Trong thập niên 1920 và 1930, Ravel được công nhận rộng rãi trên toàn thế giới là nhà soạn nhạc Pháp vĩ đại nhất còn sống. Ravel sinh ra trong một gia đình có truyền thống âm nhạc và theo học tại Nhạc viện Paris, trường âm nhạc hàng đầu của Pháp. Ông không được giới bảo thủ xem trọng tại cơ sở đào tạo này và việc họ đối xử bất công đối với ông về sau đã gây ra tai tiếng. Sau khi rời nhạc viện, Ravel tìm thấy con đường riêng của mình với tư cách là một nhà soạn nhạc; ông phát triển một phong cách rất đặc trưng và kết hợp vào âm nhạc của mình các yếu tố của chủ nghĩa hiện đại, baroque, tân cổ điển và trong những nhạc phẩm về sau là jazz.

Gjesvål eller Gisvold er en gård på Fannrem, omtrent 50 km sørvest for Trondheim. Gården har lang historie. Gårdsanlegget ligger omkring 150 meter øst for Orkdal kirke, på samme platå som denne og prestegården, og det kan ha vært bebyggelse og bosetning på platået langt tilbake i førkristen tid. Gjesvål har tilhørt erkebispesetet i Nidaros. Etter reformasjonen ble gården krongods, og fra 1600-tallet har den blant annet vært fogd-, kapellan- og lensmannsgård. Sagbruksdrift har i perioder, fra 1600-tallet og fremover, vært viktig for Gjesvål. Hovedbygningen fra 1773, med det spesielle seteritaket, er fredet. Bygningen har mange trekk til felles med trepaleene og lystgårdene i Trondheim, og det er mulig at både arkitekt og bygningsarbeidere ble hentet derfra. ► Les mer her.

175 هـ/791 م) فقيه ومحدث وإمام أهل مصر في زمانه، وصاحب أحد المذاهب الإسلامية المندثرة. وُلد في قرية قلقشندة من أسفل أعمال مصر، وأسرته أصلها فارسي من أصبهان. كان أحد أشهر الفقهاء في زمانه، فاق في علمه وفقهه إمام المدينة المنورة مالك بن أنس، غير أن تلامذته لم يقوموا بتدوين علمه وفقهه ونشره في الآفاق، مثلما فعل تلامذة الإمام مالك، وكان الإمام الشافعي يقول: «اللَّيْثُ أَفْقَهُ مِنْ مَالِكٍ إِلاَّ أَنَّ أَصْحَابَه لَمْ يَقُوْمُوا بِهِ». بلغ مبلغًا عاليًا من العلم والفقة الشرعي بِحيثُ إِنَّ مُتولِّي مصر، وقاضيها، وناظرها كانوا يرجعون إِلى رأيه، ومشُورته. عرف بأنه كان كثير الاتصال بمجالس العلم، بحيث قال ابن بكير: «سَمِعْتُ اللَّيْثَ يَقُوْلُ: سَمِعْتُ بِمَكَّةَ سَنَةَ ثَلاَثَ عَشْرَةَ وَمائَةٍ مِنَ الزُّهْرِيِّ وَأَنَا ابْنُ عِشْرِيْنَ سَنَةً». ومما كان يتميز به الإمام الليث أنه كان ذا ثروة كثيرة ولعل مصدرها الأراضي التي كان يملكها، لكنه كان رغم ذلك زاهدًا وفق ما نقله معاصروه، فكان يُطعمُ النَّاس في الشتاء الهرائس بعسل النَّحل وسمن البقر، وفي الصيف سويق اللوز في السُكَّر. أما هو فكان يأكل الخبز والزيت. وقيل في سيرته: أنه لم تجب عليه زكاة قط لأنه كان كريماً يعطي الفقراء في أيام السنة؛ فلا ينقضي الحَول عنه حتى ينفقها ويتصدق بها. مَاتَ اللَّيْثُ لِلنصف من شعبان، سنة خمس وسبعين ومائَةٍ، أي قبل وفاة الإمام مالك بأربع سنوات وقيل غير ذلك، وأقيمت له جنازة كبيرة في مصر، وقال البعض إن قبره مكان مبارك معروف بإجابة الدعاء. تابع القراءة مقالات جيدة أخرى: قلاء تنفسي – بيسون الغابات – المنصور بن أبي عامر ما هي المقالات الجيدة؟ – بوابة الإسلام – بوابة الحديث النبوي قائمة اليوم المختارة ظهير الدين محمد بابر مؤسس الدولة المغولية في الهند. حكام دولة مغول الهند هم مجموعة من الحكام التركمان الذين بنوا وحكموا الدولة المغولية (بالأوردو: مغلیہ سلطنت) (بالفارسية: گورکانیان) في جنوب آسيا، وتشمل من الدول الحديثة الآن الهند، باكستان، وبنغلاديش، في وقت مبكر من القرن السادس عشر إلى أوائل القرن الثامن عشر. تأسست دولة عام 1526م في إقليم شرق أفغانستان و شمال الهند عرفت فيما بعد باسم الإمبر",

Like (probably) 95% of the people here, I have no interest, and don\u0027t care either way. But I will point out that you can \"revive\" till you\u0027re blue in the fact, but if you don\u0027t have several people actively interested, and willing to spend time working on the project, \"reviving\" it will be an empty gesture and a waste of time. ColinFine (talk) 15:09, 3 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] I mean arent most of them dead? (inactive) YourLocalZakkFromSomewhere (talk) 19:56, 3 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] In my opinion, the best way to really promote the topic of bowling on Wikipedia would be to look for articles on that topic that need improvement, and fix them up. I think the best project for bowling is, when you get done editing, go bowling! :) TooManyFingers (talk) 16:46, 3 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] I mean I want to revive it because I do leagues for my school and a league that they have YourLocalZakkFromSomewhere (talk) 19:55, 3 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] You know your school bowling league is never getting an article on Wikipedia, right? TooManyFingers (talk) 20:29, 3 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] Yes. YourLocalZakkFromSomewhere (talk) 13:47, 4 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] Then ... I\u0027m guessing you only mentioned them because the whole thing has inspired you to try to improve Wikipedia\u0027s coverage of bowling. That\u0027s great! I hope you find lots of good sources of bowling information to improve articles or write new ones. TooManyFingers (talk) 00:46, 5 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] could it be like for PBA Players (Ex: E.J. Tackett Kyle Troup) YourLocalZakkFromSomewhere (talk) 13:50, 4 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] I don\u0027t think I understood your question. Could what be like for PBA players? TooManyFingers (talk) 00:48, 5 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] Add like a daily article about bowling in the WP:Bowling (for ex. ej tackett or 9 pin no tap bowling) YourLocalZakkFromSomewhere (talk) 14:11, 5 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] like what they do on the main page YourLocalZakkFromSomewhere (talk) 14:12, 5 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] Oh I get it! I don\u0027t know the answer, but someone somewhere will know. :) Sorry I wasn\u0027t more helpful. One thing: I wouldn\u0027t try changing it daily. The main page has enough people to keep working on it, and they always have tons of possible choices for what to put up next. Bowling doesn\u0027t have those advantages. TooManyFingers (talk) 18:04, 5 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] Like I would do it. YourLocalZakkFromSomewhere (talk) 18:05, 5 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] Per WP:BOLD, you could just start doing it. Then if anyone objects, pause what you\u0027re doing and discuss it with them until you and others reach consensus. -- Avocado (talk) 16:54, 10 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] alright (Zakk😎) 16:10, 12 December 2025 (UTC)[reply] As with any moribund Wikiproject, there are a number of things you can do to revive it: Post a query on the talkpage, provided that query is along the lines of \"please can anyone here advise if -------- is a typo or some specific bowls jargon\" and not \"would anyone watching like to revive this project?\" Check the timeline of the subject of the project and look for a notable anniversary. If one is coming up in the next couple of years, try to get it in Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries#Steps_for_suggesting_new_listings. If the article isn\u0027",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Singaporean singer and actress (1931–2024) In this Malay name, there is no surname or family name. The name Aman is a patronymic, and the person should be referred to by their given name, Asiah. The word \"bin\"/\"ibn\" or \"binti\"/\"binte\" means \u0027son of\u0027 or \u0027daughter of\u0027, respectively. Asiah Aman Asiah in 2016 Born Asiah binti Aman 29 November 1931[a] Singapore, Straits Settlements Died 30 July 2024(2024-07-30) (aged 92) Changi General Hospital, Singapore Other names Nona Asiah Occupations Singer actress Years active 1940s–1975 Spouse Ismail Kassim (ms) (m. 1955; died 1994) Children 5; including Iskandar Relatives Imam Shah (grandson) Awards Cultural Medallion, 2016 Singapore Women\u0027s Hall of Fame, 2022 Asiah binti Aman (29 November 1931[a] – 30 July 2024), known professionally as Nona Asiah, was a Singaporean singer and actress. Born in Singapore under British rule, she was the oldest of six children to a Malay mother and Indonesian father. Her career began in the 1940s when she worked as a singer during the Japanese occupation, singing Japanese songs for soldiers in camps in Seletar and Tengah. Following the end of the occupation, she began working for Radio Malaya and sang Malay-language songs with the radio\u0027s band. Her singing skills were recognised by British recording company His Master\u0027s Voice, which led to her signing a contract with them and producing a Malay cover of \"Bésame Mucho\" that became popular. She also developed her stage name Nona Asiah with her mentor Zubir Said around this time. Asiah\u0027s first film role was in 1948 when she sang on Malay film Chinta alongside P. Ramlee, both of them making their debut in this film. She went on to perform throughout the 1950s and 1960s before retiring in 1975, subsequently teaching singing and acting from the 1970s to 1980s. She was awarded the Cultural Medallion in 2016 and inducted into the Singapore Women\u0027s Hall of Fame in 2022 for her contributions to music. Her son, Iskandar Ismail, was also a Cultural Medallion recipient who predeceased her in 2014. Asiah died in 2024 following heart complications at the Changi General Hospital; she was buried in a cemetery in Lim Chu Kang. Early life and career [edit] Asiah was born on 29 November 1931 in Singapore, then a part of the Straits Settlements, to Hajar Rahmah, a bangsawan singer, and Aman Ahmad, a musician. The oldest of six siblings, she lived in a shophouse unit at Allanby Road. Asiah recalled that \"performers and football players from the nearby Jalan Besar Stadium would gather at our place.\" Her mother Hajar was a Malay Singaporean who worked as a prima donna for the Dean Tijah opera troupe.[4] Her father Aman came from Pontianak, Indonesia, and worked as a painter and musician; he painted the backdrops and sets for their troupe. Asiah\u0027s parents arrived in Singapore after being contracted to work at New World Amusement Park. She studied at a Malay school in Kampong Glam and a secondary school in Rochor. In her youth, Asiah joined school choirs due to an interest in singing.[3]: 1–4 [5] Asiah learnt English at night private schools.[3]: 8  Despite only studying up to Standard 7,[6] Asiah was a part of a wave of female performers who managed to attend primary and secondary school.[5] During the Japanese occupation, Asiah developed a love interest with a Japanese teacher, Watanabe Makoto, who was impressed by their bangsawan performances. He subsequently invited Asiah and Hajar to attend Japanese classes so they could learn Japanese and perform bangsawan in Japanese. Asiah and Hajar learnt katakana at Cathay Building, with soldiers sending them to different camps in Seletar and Tengah to perform for Japanese troops. After these shows, they received payment in cigarettes and food before being sent back to Cathay Building.[6] This was Asiah\u0027s first experience performing and singing.[6][7] Singing and acting career [edit] After the surrender of Japan, Asiah got her first paying job as a singer for a band called Tiga Serumpun (lit. \u0027Three Get-Together\u0027) at Radio Malaya in 1946. While working there, she taught Malay through songs when the station started broadcasting in schools. Asiah was soon offered a recording contract by British record label His Master\u0027s Voice (HMV), and recorded her first song, a Malay cover of \"Bésame Mucho\", in 1949 on the Pathé label,[b] which became an instant success. Asiah recorded twenty more songs for HMV by the time she turned nineteen.[6][7] Asiah, who recorded these songs with Tiga Serumpun, was often paid S$45.00 a song with additional royalties. This was considered a large sum at the time, and an executive of HMV had \"taught [them] how to open bank accounts\" as \"he was worried [they] would spend all [their] money.\"[4] This was also when she developed her stage name, Nona Asiah, which was suggested by her mentor Zubir Said. Zubir, whose songs Asiah also covered multiple songs of, was a friend of Asiah\u0027s mother, which was how ",

Med udsendelsen af sit andet album, Mer\u0027 end kærlighed, i oktober 2011 blev Seebach den hurtigst sælgende musiker i Danmark nogensinde, da albummet solgte over 42.000 eksemplarer på én uge. Samlet set har Seebach solgt over 600.000 eksemplarer af sine to første album sammen med live-albummet Rasmus Seebach Live (2012). Han har siden udgivet albummene Ingen kan love dig i morgen (2013) og Verden kan vente (2015). Seebachs musik er blevet udgivet i Sverige, Norge og Tyskland. I Sverige og Norge har han haft succes med top fem-hittet \"Natteravn\", der solgte henholdsvis guld og tredobbelt platin. I Danmark har Seebach, sammen med storebroren Nicolai, haft stor succes som sangskriver med støttesangen \"Hvor små vi er\" (2005), der solgte 13 gange platin. Seebachs succes som solomusiker er blevet tilskrevet sangenes enkle, banale tekster om \"kærlighed og byture, der i sin lyrik oftest er tale- eller SMS-sprog\", samt \"at hans livshistorie indeholder ingredienserne til en dansk pop-fortælling af de mere barske\", med henvisning til at Seebach er søn af den populære dansktopsanger Tommy Seebach, der døde af et hjertestop i 2003 efter et årelangt alkoholmisbrug.

Seneste tre uger: Lars von Trier — Juletraditioner — Jul Mere om Ugens artikel • Arkiv Dagens skandinaviske artikel Gjesvål eller Gisvold er en gård på Fannrem, omtrent 50 km sørvest for Trondheim. Gården har lang historie. Gårdsanlegget ligger omkring 150 meter øst for Orkdal kirke, på samme platå som denne og prestegården, og det kan ha vært bebyggelse og bosetning på platået langt tilbake i førkristen tid. Gjesvål har tilhørt erkebispesetet i Nidaros. Etter reformasjonen ble gården krongods, og fra 1600-tallet har den blant annet vært fogd-, kapellan- og lensmannsgård. Sagbruksdrift har i perioder, fra 1600-tallet og fremover, vært viktig for Gjesvål. Hovedbygningen fra 1773, med det spesielle seteritaket, er fredet. Bygningen har mange trekk til felles med trepaleene og lystgårdene i Trondheim, og det er mulig at både arkitekt og bygningsarbeidere ble hentet derfra. ► Les mer her.

Distinguished author Mary Agnes Chase 1869–1963. Standard IPNI form: Chase Mary Agnes Chase, née Merrill, was an American botanist who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution. She is considered one of the world\u0027s outstanding agrostologists and is known for her work on the study of grasses, and also for her work as a suffragist. Chase was born in Iroquois County, Illinois and held no formal education beyond grammar school. That aside, she made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois. She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North- as well as and South America. Her Smithsonian Field Books collection from 1897 to 1959 is archived in the Smithsonian Institution Archives. In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the Field Museum of Natural History under Charles Frederick Millspaugh, where her work was featured in two museum publications: Plantae Utowanae (1900) and Plantae Yucatanae (1904). Two years later, Chase joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a botanical illustrator and eventually became a scientific assistant in systematic agrostology (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under Albert Spear Hitchcock. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing, for instance The North American Species of Panicum (1910). Following Hitchcock\u0027s death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the United States National Museum (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939, but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963. She was an Honorary Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution (1959) and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (1961). Agnesia is named in her honour (a monotypic genus of herbaceous South American bamboo in the grass family). Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition\u0027s benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men. During World War I, Chase marched with Alice Paul and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the Silent Sentinels rally picketing the White House; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed. The USDA accused her of \"conduct unbecoming a government employee,\" but Hitchcock helped her keep her job. Chase was also an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). See also: Distinguished authors of previous months.

Починаючи з 1930-х років він побудував понад двадцять музичних інструментів, серед яких модифіковані альти, гітари, кіфари, маримби, фісгармонії, канони та багато інших. Музика Гаррі Парча написана в чистому строї, що походив зі Стародавньої Греції і вимагав настроювання інструментів «на слух». В XIX столітті в європейській музиці чистий стрій витіснила рівномірна темперація, що дозволяла грати на клавішних інструментах в будь-якій тональності. Натомість Парч вважав чистий стрій більш відповідним власним композиційним потребам. Він ділив октаву не на 12 півтонів, а на 43 нерівномірні інтервали натурального звукоряду, утворені основним тоном та його гармонічними обертонами. Більшість сучасних інструментів не підтримувала такий стрій, тож Парчу довелося будувати власні інструменти. Парч починав із невеликих композицій під акомпанемент поодиноких інструментів, та поступово перейшов до створення масштабних вистав, які називав «тотальним театром», що поєднували спів, танець, декламацію та гру на музичних інструментах.

He resigned on 11 December 2025 following mass protests. He previously served as Minister of Transport from 2018 to 2021, Member of the National Assembly from 2021 to 2025, and Speaker of the National Assembly from 2023 to 2024. He is a member of the conservative GERB party. Early life, education, and career [edit] Zhelyazkov was born in Sofia on 5 April 1968. He earned a master\u0027s degree in Law from Sofia University. In 1994, he began his career as a legal advisor for Sofia Municipality\u0027s Sredets district, where he held senior legal positions as well as positions in the local administration.[4] In 1995, he was accepted into the Sofia Lawyers Association as an attorney specialising in civil and commercial law.[4][5] Political career [edit] Municipal administration [edit] Zhelyazkov held his first political position from 1998 to 1999, when he was Deputy Mayor for \"Law and Control\" of Lozenets district.[5][6][4][7] In 2003, he was appointed as Secretary of Sofia Municipality by then-mayor Stefan Sofiyanski and was re-appointed to the role after the election of Boyko Borisov in 2005.[8] In 2009, after Borisov became prime-minister, Zhelyazkov was given the post of Secretary to the Ministerial Council, a position responsible for the administrative functions of the cabinet.[8] State Administrator [edit] Zhelyazkov served as Secretary to the Ministerial Cabinet between 2009 and 2013 under both Borisov and interim Prime Minister Marin Raykov.[5][6][4][7] In addition, he also served as chairman of the board of the Institute for Public Administration from 2011 to 2013 and represented Bulgaria at the European Institute for Public Administration (EIPA).[9] As secretary to the cabinet under the Raykov Government, Zhelyazkov was implicated in the so-called \"Kostinbrod affair\" surrounding the 2013 Bulgarian parliamentary election. A number of political parties, most notably the BSP, alleged that around 350,000 ballots were printed illegally at a facility in Kostinbrod with the authorisation of the caretaker government.[10] As part of the investigation, Zhelyazkov was charged by the Prosecutor\u0027s Office for dereliction of his duty to oversee the proper printing of ballots.[11] In 2014, the Sofia City Court found no evidence of wrongdoing by Zhelyazkov and ruled that he was innocent.[12] From 2016 to 2017, Zhelyazkov served as a Public Administration and e-Government advisor to Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.[5][6][4][13] In this role, he helped draft legislation for the implementation of e-government in Bulgaria and represented the country at the annual summit for open government partnership.[9] Zhelyazkov was nominated for the position of Chairman of the Commission for the Protection of Competitiveness by GERB in April 2016, but ultimately withdrew his candidacy due to a lack of competition and after an appeal by Borisov for his party to withdraw from the process.[14] On 30 September 2016, he was appointed Chairman of the newly-created State e-Government Agency.[5][4][15] In this role, Zhelyazkov was responsible for overseeing the digitalisation of state services and the implementation of online solutions for government-issued documents.[16][17] In October 2017, he was appointed as head of the Commission for the Regulation of Messages, responsible for overseeing the postal, radio, and e-signature state services.[18] Minister of Transport [edit] On 20 September 2018, Zhelyazkov was elected by the National Assembly as Minister of Transport, Information Technology, and Communications.[5][4] His appointment to the position came following the resignation of his predecessor, Ivaylo Moskovski, following a traffic accident near the town of Svoge.[19] Shortly after his election, Zhelyazkov promised to work closely with the Natio",

Oni lin nomas ankaŭ Peter Paul, Pieter Paul, Pieter Pauwel aŭ Petrus Paulus.

Ĝi celas liveri en Esperanto liberan, objektivan kaj kontroleblan enhavon, kiun ĉiuj povas redakti. La projekto estas difinita de la kvin principoj. La enhavo estas disponigata sub la permesilo Krea Komunaĵo Atribuite-Samkondiĉe kaj oni povas kopii kaj reuzi ĝin sub la sama permesilo — eĉ por komercaj celoj — nur respektante la uzkondiĉojn. Ĉiuj redaktantoj de Esperanta Vikipedio estas volontuloj. Ili partoprenas en la kunlaborema komunumo, sen estro, kie la anoj kunordigas siajn strebojn kadre de temaj projektoj kaj pluraj diskutejoj. Ili sekvas la bazajn regulojn establitajn de la komunumo, ekzemple kontrolebleco de la informo aŭ la menciindeco de la temo. Inter la diversaj helpopaĝoj disponeblaj al uloj interesataj kontribui, estas la paĝoj, kiuj instruas kiel krei paĝon aŭ kiel redakti paĝon. Se vi havas demandojn, ne hezitu demandi.

United States Secretary of State Seal of the secretary of state Flag of the secretary of state Incumbent Marco Rubio since January 21, 2025 United States Department of State Style Mr. Secretary (informal) The Honorable[1] (formal) His Excellency[2] (diplomatic) Abbreviation SecState Member of Cabinet of the United States United States National Security Council Reports to President of the United States Seat Harry S Truman Building Washington, D.C. Appointer The president with Senate advice and consent Term length No fixed term Constituting instrument 22 U.S.C. § 2651 Precursor Secretary of Foreign Affairs Formation July 27, 1789; 236 years ago (1789-07-27) First holder Thomas Jefferson Succession Fourth[3] Deputy United States Deputy Secretary of State Salary Executive Schedule, Level I[4] Website state.gov/secretary The United States secretary of state (SecState)[5] is a member of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States and the head of the U.S. Department of State, equivalent to a minister of foreign affairs. The secretary of state serves as the principal advisor to the president of the United States on all foreign affairs matters. The secretary carries out the president\u0027s foreign policies through the U.S Department of State, which includes the Foreign Service, Civil Service, and U.S. Agency for International Development. The office holder is the second-highest-ranking member of the president\u0027s cabinet, after the vice president, and ranks fourth in the presidential line of succession; and is first amongst cabinet secretaries. Created in 1789 with Thomas Jefferson as its first office holder, the secretary of state represents the United States to foreign countries, and is therefore considered analogous to a secretary or minister of foreign affairs in other countries.[6][7] The secretary of state is nominated by the president of the United States and, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, is confirmed by the Senate. The secretary of state, along with the secretary of the treasury, secretary of defense, and attorney general, are generally regarded as the four most crucial Cabinet members because of the importance of their respective departments.[8] The secretary of state is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level, $250,600 as of January 2025[update].[4][9] History [edit] The secretary of state originates from the government under the Articles of Confederation. The Congress of the Confederation established the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1781 and created the office of secretary of foreign affairs.[10] After the Constitution of the United States was ratified, the 1st United States Congress reestablished the department, renaming it the Department of State, and created the office of secretary of state to lead the department.[11][12] Duties and responsibilities [edit] The stated duties of the secretary of state are to supervise the United States foreign service and immigration policy and administer the Department of State. The secretary must also advise the president on U.S. foreign matters such as the appointment of diplomats and ambassadors, advising the president of the dismissal and recall of these people. The secretary of state can conduct negotiations, interpret, and terminate treaties relating to foreign policy. The secretary also can participate in international conferences, organizations, and agencies as a representative of the United States. The secretary communicates issues relating to the U.S. foreign policy to Congress and citizens. The secretary also provides services to U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad such as providing credentials in the form of passports. Doing this, the secretary also ensures the protection of citizens, their property, and interests in foreign countries.[13] What are the Qualifications of a Secretary of State? He ought to be a Man of universal Reading in Laws, Governments, History. Our whole terrestrial Universe ought to be summarily comprehended in his Mind. —John Adams[14] Secretaries of state also have domestic responsibilities. Most of the historical domestic functions of the Department of State were gradually transferred to other agencies by the late 19th century as part of various administrative reforms and restructurings.[15] Those that remain include storage and use of the Great Seal, performance of protocol functions for the White House, and the drafting of certain proclamations. The secretary also negotiates with the individual states over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries.[13] Under federal law, the resignation of a president or of a vice president is valid only if declared in writing, in an instrument delivered to the office of the secretary of state.[16] Acco",

Find sources: \"Social media\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (December 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A variety of popular social media app icons Social media are new media technologies that facilitate the creation, sharing and aggregation of content (such as ideas, interests, and other forms of expression) amongst virtual communities and networks.[1][2] Common features include:[2] Online platforms enable users to create and share content and participate in social networking.[2][3][4] User-generated content—such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through online interactions.[2][3] Service-specific profiles that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.[2][5] Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user\u0027s profile with those of other individuals or groups.[2][5] The term social in regard to media suggests platforms enable communal activity. Social media helps people connect and build networks.[6] Users access social media through web-based or mobile applications. These interactive platforms allow individuals, communities, businesses, and organizations to share, co-create, discuss, participate in, and modify user-generated or self-curated content.[7][5][1] Social media is used to share memories, form friendships, and learn.[8] They may be used to promote people, companies, products, and ideas.[8] Social media can be used to consume, publish, or share news. Popular social media platforms with over 100 million registered users include Twitter, Facebook, WeChat, ShareChat, Instagram, Pinterest, QZone, Weibo, VK, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, Threads and LinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube, Letterboxd, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Viber, Reddit, Discord, and TikTok. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation. Social media outlets differ from old media (e.g. newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality,[9] reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence.[10] Social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (many sources to many receivers) while traditional media operate under a monologic transmission model (one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city.[11] Social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers, including exposure to inappropriate content, exploitation by adults, sleep problems, attention problems, feelings of exclusion, and various mental health maladies.[12][13] Social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy, exacerbated by platform capture by vested interests,[14][15] with journalist Maria Ressa deeming it \"toxic sludge\" for increasing distrust among members of society.[16] Major news outlets often have strong controls in place to avoid and fix false claims, but social media\u0027s unique qualities bring viral content with little to no oversight. \"Algorithms that track user engagement to prioritize what is shown tend to favor content that spurs negative emotions like anger and outrage. Overall, most online misinformation originates from a small minority of \"superspreaders,\" but social media amplifies their reach and influence.\"[17] History See also: Timeline of social media Early computing The PLATO system was launched in 1960 at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation. It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes, PLATO\u0027s message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowdsourced online newspaper, and blog and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers.[18] ARPANET, which came online in 1969, had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the network etiquette (or \"netiquette\") described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MIT\u0027s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[19] ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the 1990s.[20] Usenet, conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, was the first open social media app, established in 1980.

Првобитно је установљен као празник „на начин Сукота“, нису успостављене одговарајуће обавезе, што га чини релативно малим празником у строго вјерском смислу, али је достигао велики културни значај у Сјеверној Америци и другдје, посебно међу секуларним Јеврејима, због тога што се често дешава отприлике у исто вријеме када и Божић током празничне сезоне. Обиљежава се осам ноћи и дана, почевши од 25. дана кислева по хебрејском календару, који пада у периоду од краја новембра до краја децембра по грегоријанском календару. Слави се паљењем свијећа канделабра са девет грана, који се обично назива менора или ханукија. Једна грана се обично поставља изнад или испод других и њена свијећа се користи за паљење осталих осам. Та јединствена свијећа се зове шамаш (שמש‎, „послужитељ“). Сваке вечери шамаш пали још једну свијећу док се свих осам свијећа не упали заједно последње вечери фестивала. Друге свечаности за Хануку укључују пјевање пјесама, играње игре дрејдел и једење млијечне хране и хране на бази уља, као што су суфганијот крофне и врсте палачинки латкес. Од 1970-их, свјетски хасидски покрет Хабад је покренуо јавно паљење меноре на отвореним јавним мјестима у многим земљама.

Caprimulgus europaeus), врста је крепускуларне (активна у сумрак) и ноћне птице из фамилије легњева, која се гнезди широм Европе и умерене Азије. Латинско име рода се односи на стари мит о овој птици као ноћној животињи која сиса козе и изазива престанак продукције млека. Постоји шест подврста које имају клинасту дистрибуцију, која се огледа у смањењу величине тела и светлијој обојености перја идући ка истоку ареала распрострањења. Све популације су миграторне и зиму проводе у субсахарској Африци. Његово криптично (камуфлажно) обојено перје омогућава му одличну заштиту током дана, када је птица практично неприметна док лежи непомично на земљи или грани. Код мужјака у лету се могу видети беле флеке по крилима и репу. Насељава сува, отворена станишта са проређеним стаблима и малим жбуновима, као што су вресишта, шумски прореди или тек посађена шума. Мужјак легња први долази на територију гнежђења и креће са карактеристичним оглашавањем, који неистренираном уху звучи као жаба. Он обилази територију и тера конкуренте карактеристичним звуком који прави ударајући крила о тело. Ударање крилима се може чути приликом спиралног лета удварања мужјака у присуству женке. Ова врста не гради гнездо, већ јаја (најчешће два) полаже директно на земљу. Инкубација траје 17—21 дан, а браон паперјасти младунци стасавају за 16—17 дана.

Од 1924. до распада Савеза 1991. године, носилац функције је био препознат као лидер Совјетског Савеза. Званично, генерални секретар је искључиво директно контролисао Комунистичку партију. Међутим, пошто је партија имала монопол на политичку власт, генерални секретар је дефакто имао извршну контролу над совјетском владом. Због тежине функције која је обликовала спољну и унутрашњу политику државе и примат над совјетском Комунистичком партијом, то је била дефакто највиша функција у Совјетском Савезу. Генерални секретар је председавао састанцима Извршног комитета или Политичког бироа (Политбиро), тела које је чинило 15–30 чланова. Састајао се по потреби недељно или пар пута месечно. Председавао је и Централним комитетом, органом величине око стотину до две хиљаде чланова. Заседао је пар пута годишње. Председавао је такође и конгресима, који су се одржавали, практично по потреби, у периоду од четири до пет година. У зависности од сложености одлуке коју је требало донети доносио ју је сам или на састанцима одговарајућих органа.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Byzantine emperor from 715 to 717 This article is about the Byzantine emperor. For the 10th-century Abkhazian ruler, see Theodosius III of Abkhazia. For the pope of Alexandria, see Pope Theodosius III of Alexandria. Theodosius III Emperor of the Romans Solidus of Theodosius III. The inscription reads d n theodosius mul a. Byzantine emperor Reign c. May 715 – 25 March 717 Predecessor Anastasius II Successor Leo III Died After 717, possibly on 24 July 754 Issue Theodosius Dynasty Twenty Years\u0027 Anarchy Father Tiberius III? Theodosius III (Greek: Θεοδόσιος, romanized: Theodósios) was the Byzantine emperor from c. May 715 to 25 March 717. Before rising to power and seizing the throne of the Byzantine Empire, he was a tax collector in Adramyttium. In 715, the Byzantine navy and the troops of the Opsician Theme, one of the Byzantine provinces, revolted against Emperor Anastasius II (r. 713–715), acclaiming the reluctant Theodosius as emperor. Theodosius led his troops to Chrysopolis and then Constantinople, the capital, seizing the city in November 715. Anastasius did not surrender until several months later, accepting exile in a monastery in return for safety. Many themes viewed Theodosius to be a puppet of the troops of the Opsician Theme, and his legitimacy was denied by the Anatolics and the Armeniacs under their respective strategoi (generals) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos. Leo declared himself emperor in the summer of 716 and allied himself with the Umayyad Caliphate, the Islamic empire; Theodosius sought aid from the Bulgarians under Khan Tervel (r. 700–721), setting a firm border at Thrace and ceding the Zagoria region to the Bulgarians, as well as stipulating the payment of tribute to them. Leo then marched his troops to Constantinople, seizing the city of Nicomedia, and capturing many officials, including Theodosius\u0027s son, also named Theodosius. With his son in captivity, Theodosius took the advice of Patriarch Germanus and the Byzantine Senate, and negotiated with Leo, agreeing to abdicate and recognize Leo as emperor. Leo entered Constantinople and definitively seized power on 25 March 717, allowing Theodosius and his son to retire to a monastery. Exactly when Theodosius died is uncertain, but it may have been on 24 July 754. History [edit] Background [edit] A map of the Byzantine Empire during the Twenty Years\u0027 Anarchy After the Umayyad Caliphate was repelled at the first Arab siege of Constantinople (674–678), the Arabs and Byzantines experienced a period of peace between each other.[1] Hostilities were resumed by Byzantine Emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695, 705–711), resulting in a string of Arab victories. As a consequence, the Byzantines lost control over Armenia and the Caucasian principalities, and the Arabs gradually encroached upon the Byzantine borderlands. Annually, generals from the Caliphate would launch raids into Byzantine territory, seizing fortresses and towns.[2][3][4] After 712, the defenses of the Byzantine Empire weakened, as Arab raids penetrated deeper into Byzantine Asia Minor, and Byzantine response to these raids became less common; much of the frontier became depopulated, as the inhabitants were either killed, enslaved, or driven away. A result of this was that many frontier forts, especially in Cilicia, were gradually abandoned.[5][6] The success of these raids emboldened the Arabs, who prepared for a second assault against Constantinople as early as the reign of Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715). After his death, his successor, Sulayman (r. 715–717) continued planning the campaign,[7][8][9] Sulayman began assembling his forces in late 716, on the plain of Dabiq, north of Aleppo, entrusting the command of these forces to his brother, Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik.[10][11] The Slavs and Bulgars also formed a growing threat to the northern frontier of the Byzantine Empire, threatening Byzantine control in the Balkans.[12] During the rule of Byzantine Emperor Philippicus (r. 711–713), in 712, the Bulgarians under Khan Tervel advanced as far as the walls of Constantinople itself, plundering the surrounding country, including villas and estates near the capital, where the Byzantine elites often summered.[13] Theodosius came to power during a period called the Twenty Years\u0027 Anarchy, defined by struggles between the emperors and the elites, and political instability, with a rapid succession of emperors. The nobles of this time were often natives of Asia Minor, and rarely had a strong agenda beyond preventing the emperors from growing stronger and disrupting the status quo.[14][15] The Twenty Years\u0027 Anarchy began when Emperor Justinian II was overthrown by Leontius (r. 695–698) in 695, ending the Heraclian dynasty, which had retained power for eighty years. During this period of anarchy, seven different emperors took the throne, including a restored Justinian for a time.[15] The modern historian Romilly Jenkins states that between 695 a",

Haftanın seçkin maddesi Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), Avustralya\u0027ya özgü otobur ve ağaçta yaşayan bir keseli memeli hayvan türüdür. Phascolarctidae familyasının yaşayan tek temsilcisidir ve yaşayan en yakın akrabaları vombatlardır. Koalalar, Avustralya\u0027nın doğu ve güney kıyıları boyunca Queensland, Yeni Güney Galler, Victoria ve Güney Avustralya eyaletlerinde bulunur. Vücut uzunlukları 60 ila 85 cm, ağırlıkları ise 4 ila 15 kg arasında değişiklik gösterir. Kürkü, gümüşi gri ile çikolata rengi arasındaki renklerdedir. Kuzey popülasyonlarındaki bireyler, genellikle güneyde yaşayanlardan daha küçük ve daha açık renklidir. Bu iki popülasyonun alt türler olması konusu ise tartışmalıdır. Besinlerinin büyük bölümünü okaliptüs ağaçlarının yapraklarından elde eden koalalar, genelde bu ağaçlardan oluşan ormanlık alanlarda yaşar. Bu yaprakların besin değeri ve kalori içeriği sınırlı olduğundan dolayı koalalar genellikle sedanter bir yaşam sürer ve günde 20 saate kadar uyur. (Devamı...)

പ്രദേശങ്ങളിലൊന്നാണിത്. \"അപ്രാപ്യമായ മല\" എന്നാണ് അണ്ണാമലൈ എന്ന പദത്തിനർത്ഥം. പ്രത്യേകിച്ച് അഗ്നിയുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ട പഞ്ചഭൂത ക്ഷേത്രങ്ങളിലൊന്നാണിത്. ശിവൻ അണ്ണാമലൈയാർ അഥവാ അരുണാചലേശ്വർ എന്ന പേരിൽ

    "content": "Hankany amin\u0027ny vontoatiny Avy amin\u0027i Wikipedia Tonga soa eto amin’i Wikipedia ny raki-pahalalana malalaka azon’ny tsirairay ovaina Lahatsoratra 101 544 amin’ny teny malagasy Pejy rehetra · Sokajy · Fikambanana · Fanoroana Lahatsoratra notsongaina ho an’ity volana ity I Iràna na Repoblika Islamikan\u0027 i Iràna dia firenena ao Azia Andrefana. Ny renivohiny dia i Teheran. Atao hoe ایران‎ [ʔiˈɾɒn] na جمهوری اسلامی ایران‎ / Jomhuri-ye Eslāmi-ye Irān izy amin\u0027 ny fiteny persana. Ny anarana nohagasina hoe Iràna dia avy amin\u0027 ny fiteny persana izay midika hoe \"Tanin\u0027 ny Arianina\", ary efa nampiasain\u0027 ny Persiana hatry ny Andro Taloha, tamin\u0027 ny andron\u0027 ny Sasanida. Persia no fiantsoan\u0027 ny Tandrefana an\u0027 i Iràna nanomboka tamin\u0027 ny Andro Taloha hatramin\u0027 ny taona 1935. I Reza Shah no nanova izany ho Irān tamin\u0027 io taona io tamin\u0027 ny alalan\u0027 ny fangatahana amin\u0027 ny firenena rehetra izay mifandray aminy hiantso an\u0027 ilay firenena hoe \"Irān\". Sarin-tanin\u0027 i Iràna Firenena faha-18 be velarana indrindra (1 648 000 km2) i Iràna; 78 tapitrisa ny isan\u0027 ny mponina ao aminy. I Armenia sy i Azerbaijàna ary i Torkmenistàna no firenena manodidina azy ao avaratra; ny Hoala Persika no ao atsimo; i Iràka sy i Torkia no firenena manodidina azy ao andrefana; i Pakistàna sy i Afganistàna no ao atsinanany. Ny vola ampiasaina ao Iràna dia ny Rial. Ny kalandrie persana no kalandrie ôfisialy ary ny fiteny persana no fiteny ôfisialy. Ahitana lembalemba avo, izay manana salan-kaambo 1 300 m, ny ampahany be amin\u0027 ny tanin\u0027 i Iràna. Ahitana tany efitra roa lehibe ny any, dia i Dasht-e Kavir ao avaratra sy i Dasht-e Lut ao atsimo-atsinanana. Hodidinin’ ny tangoron-tendrombohitra maro koa i Iràna: ao avaratra manamorona ny Ranomasina Kaspiana no misy an\u0027 ny tangoron-tendrombohitra Alborz; ao atsimo-andrefana i Zagros. Ny toerana iva indrindra any Iràna dia ny Ranomasina Kaspiana izay 28 m ambanin\u0027 ny haambon\u0027 ny ranomasina. Toetanin-tanibe maina ny toetanin\u0027 i Iràna, izay ahitana fiovaovana lehibe eo amin\u0027 ny mari-pana. Haingam-pitombo sady betsaka tanora (ny 44 % dia latsaky ny 15 taona) ary monina an-tanan-dehibe (ny 65 %, na mihoatra, dia monina an-tanàn-dehibe) ankamaroan\u0027 ny mponina ao Iràna. Ny Persiana sy vahoaka vitsy anisa maro (anisan\u0027 izany ny Azery, ny Balotsy, ny Torkmena, ny Kiorda ary ny Arabo) no madrafitra ny mponina any Iràna. Ny fivavahana silamo no fivavahan\u0027 ny 99 % amin\u0027 ny mponina any Iràna. I Iràna no mpanondrana solitany fahefatra maneran-tany. Na dia ny 10 % amin\u0027 ny tany ihany aza no voavoly dia manan-danja eo amin\u0027 ny toekaren\u0027 i Iràna ny fambolena. I Iràna, ohatra, no mpamokatra antrendry voalohany indrindra maneran-tany. Izy koa no miantoka ny 20 %n\u0027 ny famokarana kaviara maneran-tany. (tohiny...) Lahatsoratra tsara vakiana Ankizy mahafaly Ny Mahafaly dia vondrom-poko ao amin\u0027 ny faritra atsimo-andrefana amin\u0027 i Madagasikara, eo anelanelan\u0027 ny ony Menarandra ao atsimo sy Onilahy ao avaratra no fonenany nentim-paharazana, eo amin\u0027 ny lembalemba be sokay sy fasika izay mitondra io anarana Mahafaly io ihany. Malaza amin\u0027 ny fahaizana manao sary sokitra ny Mahafaly ka isan\u0027 izany ny fanamboarana aloalo izay entiny manaingo ny fasana sy manaja ny razana sy ny mpanjaka maty. I Betioky sy i Ejeda ary i Ampanihy no tanàna ngezangeza ao aminy. Anisan\u0027 ny fady amin\u0027 ny Mahafaly, toy ny Antandroy koa, ny mihinana sokatra (mahafaly: sokake). Tamin\u0027 ny taona 2013 dia tombanana ho 150 000 ny isan\u0027 ny Mahafaly[1]. Mpiompy omby sy osy sy ondry ary akoho amam-borona (anisan\u0027 izany ny vorontsiloza) ny Mahafaly. Mamboly mangahazo sy voamaina koa ny mponina amin\u0027 ny faritra mahafaly. Heverina ho avy ao amin\u0027 ny faritra atsimo-atsinanan\u0027 i Afrika ny sasany amin\u0027 ny razamben\u0027 ny Mahafaly voalohany izay tonga teto amin \u0027 ny Nosy tamin\u0027 ny taonjato faha-12. Nanjary malaza izy ireo noho ny fasana lehibe aoriny ho fanomezam-boninahitra ny lehibe sy ny mpanjaka maty. Miteny mahafaly, izay fitenim-paritra mifanakaiky amin\u0027 ny fiteny antandroy, izay fiteny malagasy, sampan\u0027 ny vondrom-piteny malaiô-pôlineziana ny Mahafaly. Ny anarana hoe Mahafaly dia nampiasain\u0027 ny Malagasy hafa sy ny vahiny hilazana ireo olona nipetraka amin\u0027 ny morontsiraka atsimo-andrefan\u0027 i Madagasikara, voafaritry ny ony Menarandra sy Onilahy[2]. Ny Mahafaly tenany anefa tsy mampiasa an\u0027 io teny io ary tsy milaza azy ireo ho foko tokana, fa aleony manonona ny tenany araka ny firazanana hafa na ara-jeôpôlitika; ny anarana hoe Mahafaly dia tsy misy heviny ho an\u0027 ny olona avy amin\u0027 io faritra io fa mari-pamantarana napetraky ny avy any ivelany[3]. Ny ankamaroan\u0027 ny Mahafaly dia monina amin\u0027 ny moron\u0027 ny renirano sy ony mamakivaky faritra tena maina[4]. (tohiny...)

Le cheval Castillonnais, ou cheval de Castillon, est une race de petits chevaux de selle montagnards et rustiques d\u0027origine française. Connu et décrit au début du XXe siècle, ce petit cheval a failli disparaître en parallèle de l\u0027adoption croissante de la motorisation, entre autres par le croisement avec des chevaux de trait. Il est sauvegardé de justesse par quelques éleveurs durant les années 1980 et 1990. Reconnu par les Haras nationaux en 1996, il reste à faible effectifs. Une association d\u0027éleveurs et le haras national de Tarbes se mobilisent pour sauvegarder et préserver cette race. De robe bai-brun ou bai foncé, il est très proche du Mérens avec lequel il partage de nombreuses caractéristiques, mais nettement moins connu. C\u0027est un bon cheval de loisir qui peut être monté en randonnée et attelé avec succès. Il vit principalement à l\u0027extrémité sud-ouest de l\u0027Ariège, dans les Pyrénées, dans un terroir éponyme caractérisé par la vallée du Lez, près de Saint-Girons. Son élevage s\u0027est étendu à d\u0027autres régions de France, notamment en Haute-Saône.

After attending Mayfield High School in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and playing college football for the Colorado Buffaloes, he was selected 65th overall by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 1995 NFL draft. During his time in the NFL, he played for the Packers, Chiefs, Lions, Browns, Vikings, and Broncos. He left the NFL in 2004. Ordained as a Baptist minister in 2015, he served as a pastor for over ten years and joined the Colorado Army National Guard as a military chaplain in 2017. He joined active duty in 2020, and as of 2025[update] is a reservist. Early life [edit] Darius Jerome Holland was born on November 10, 1973, in Petersburg, Virginia.[1] He grew up on a military base, and attended Catholic services with his mother. His father died when he was 12 years old.[2] Holland attended Mayfield High School in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and was an all-state player at the defensive tackle position. He attended college at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he was a \"standout\" player according to the Albuquerque Journal. In his last year at Boulder, he started every game and made 77 tackles. The Associated Press named him as an honorable mention in the Big Eight Conference. He finished his college career in the 1995 Hula Bowl.[3] NFL career [edit] In the 1995 NFL draft, the Green Bay Packers selected him as the first pick in the third round, 65th overall.[3] Holland played with the Packers from 1995 to 1997, including their win in Super Bowl XXXI.[4] While with the Packers, he changed from defensive tackle to defensive end. On May 13, 1998, the Packers traded Holland to the Kansas City Chiefs for Vaughn Booker.[5] In October 1998, the Chiefs waived Holland; shortly thereafter, the Detroit Lions signed him.[6][7] Holland played for the Cleveland Browns in 1999 and 2000. After being released by the Browns following the 2000 season, Holland did not play in 2001; he was signed by the Minnesota Vikings in May 2002.[8] He joined the Denver Broncos in 2003.[1] With the Broncos, he was Team Representative from 2003-2004.[4] In December 2004, Denver waived Holland.[9] Ministry [edit] While he grew up attending Roman Catholic services with his mother, he did not pay much attention. At the end of his NFL career, Holland found himself at a low point and began practicing Christianity again.[2] Holland earned a Master of Theological Studies from Gateway Seminary in 2015, and a Doctorate of Ministry in 2021. He served as the pastor at True Life Church in Thornton, Colorado, for more than ten years. Holland is a Southern Baptist.[2] During his time with the Green Bay Packers Holland played alongside Reggie White, who was an ordained minister at the same time as being a player.[3] Military [edit] A veteran suicide near his home inspired him to look into Army chaplaincy.[10] In 2017, Holland was commissioned as a chaplain in the Colorado National Guard. In 2020, he joined active duty and was assigned to Fort Bragg.[2] As of 2025[update], he is in the Army Reserve and the chaplain of a recruiting battalion at Fort Knox, and holds the rank of Captain.[11] References [edit] ^ a b \"Darius Holland Stats, Height, Weight, Position, Draft, College\".

La fisica es la sciéncia naturala qu’estudia lei proprietats fondamentalas de la matèria e de l’espaci temps. Son nom vèn d’un mòt grèc liat a l’explicacion e a la significacion dei causas de la natura. Vengut fòrça rar après la fin de l’Empèri Roman, lo mòt « fisica » venguèt tornarmai popular a partir dau sègle XVII per designar la sciéncia novèla pertocant lo movement dei còrs e dei proprietats dei materiaus. Aquela sciéncia se desvolopa gràcias a l’utilizacion d’un metòde scientific per desvolopar de modèls validats o non per la realizacion d’experiéncias. La fisica es donc un dei domenis scientifics modèrns pus vièlh de l’istòria umana. Au començament dau sègle XXI, èra devesida entre divèrsei teorias centralas (relativitat, mecanica quantica...) e disciplinas especializadas (fisica dei particulas, fisica atomica, optica...) Pasmens, per mescla ambé d’autrei disciplinas scientificas, la fisica a tanben donat naissança a de camps interdisciplinaris grands coma la quimia fisica o la biofisica. Gràcias a sei relacions ambé d’autrei disciplinas scientificas, la fisica a tanben un nombre grand d’aplicacions tecnologicas dins la vida quotidiana. Mai d\u0027articles O sabiatz?

(July 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Head of the Allied occupation of Japan The Dai-Ichi Seimei Building which served as SCAP headquarters, c. 1950 The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (Japanese: 連合国軍最高司令官, romanized: Rengōkokugun saikōshireikan), or SCAP, was the title held by General Douglas MacArthur during the United States–led Allied occupation of Japan following World War II. It issued SCAP Directives (alias SCAPIN, SCAP Index Number) to the Japanese government, aiming to suppress its \"militaristic nationalism\".[1] The position was created at the start of the occupation of Japan on August 14, 1945.[2] It was originally styled the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers.[3] In Japan, the position was generally referred to as GHQ (General Headquarters), as SCAP also referred to the offices of the occupation (which was officially referred by SCAP itself as General Headquarters, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (連合国軍最高司令官総司令部, Rengōkokugun saikōshireikan sōshireibu; abbreviated as GHQ–SCAP)), including a staff of several hundred US civil servants as well as military personnel. Some of these personnel effectively wrote a first draft of the Japanese Constitution, which the National Diet then ratified after a few amendments. Australian, British Empire, and New Zealand forces under SCAP were organized into a sub-command known as British Commonwealth Occupation Force. These actions led MacArthur to be viewed as the new Imperial force in Japan by many Japanese political and civilian figures, even being considered to be the rebirth of the shōgun-style government[4]: 341  which Japan was ruled under until the start of the Meiji Restoration. American biographer William Manchester argues that without MacArthur\u0027s leadership, Japan would not have been able to make the move from an imperial, totalitarian state to a democracy. At his appointment, MacArthur announced that he sought to \"restore security, dignity and self-respect\" to the Japanese people.[5] MacArthur was also in charge of southern Korea from 1945 to 1948 due to the lack of clear orders or initiative from Washington, D.C. There was no plan or guideline given to MacArthur from the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the State Department on how to rule Korea, resulting in a tumultuous 3 year military occupation that led to the creation of the U.S.-friendly Republic of Korea in 1948. He ordered Lieutenant General John R. Hodge, who accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in southern Korea in September 1945, to govern that area on SCAP\u0027s behalf and report to him in Tokyo.[6][7] General MacArthur [edit] Main article: Douglas MacArthur MacArthur arrives at Atsugi airfield in Kanagawa, August 30th, 1945 SCAP is oftentimes synonymous with its appointed post war leader, American General Douglas MacArthur. As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, MacArthur decided not to prosecute Shirō Ishii and all members of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. On May 6, 1947, he wrote to Washington that \"additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as \u0027War Crimes\u0027 evidence.\"[8] The deal was concluded in 1948.[9] According to historian Herbert Bix in Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, \"MacArthur\u0027s truly extraordinary measures to save the Emperor from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.\"[10] MacArthur\u0027s reasoning was that if the emperor were executed or sentenced to life imprisonment there would be a violent backlash and revolution from the Japanese of all social classes, and this would interfere with his primary goal of changing Japan from a militarist, feudal society to a pro-Western modern democracy. In a cable sent to General Dwight Eisenhower in February 1946, MacArthur stated that executing or imprisoning the emperor would require the use of one million occupation soldiers to keep the peace.[11] SCAP\u0027s relationship with Japanese leadership [edit] General MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito, 29th of Se",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This page in a nutshell: What gets posted is NOT solely based on what is “the most important or significant”. Article quality and the mix of topics listed are also considered. There are a variety of ways to contribute. Shortcut WP:OTDWP:OTD Selected anniversaries / On this day archive All January February March April May June July August September October November December Recent changes Editing guidelines It is now 18:57 on Monday, December 15, 2025 (UTC)|Purge cache for this page This set of pages serves as a queue of selected anniversaries which populate the section of the Main Page each day. These pages also help facilitate and coordinate updates to this queue. The selected anniversaries are taken from events in history on each day of the year and holidays/observances from current lunar-based calendars including Jewish and Islamic, and others. How to contribute to the project Editors can contribute to the Selected Anniversaries project in three main ways: Identify entries on the project pages that are currently \u0027ineligible\u0027 in the \u0027staging area\u0027 (see next section) and make improvements to become eligible. The reason for the entries being ineligible may be, for example, due to criteria 4-6 listed below. Make improvements to the selected article (the boldfaced link in the entry) to resolve the issue(s), then post a message on the project talk page for that day noting the improvements made and that the entry is ready to be considered to move to the \u0027eligible\u0027 section. An administrator or regular editor working on the project will come along to review the improvements and move it to the \u0027eligible\u0027 section in due course.[nb 1] Make suggestions for new entries to be included in the project pages (see \u0027Steps for suggesting new listings\u0027 below). Anticipate upcoming anniversaries that are significant or notable (e.g., due to a centenary) and may be particularly worthwhile including in the \"On this day\" section of the Main Page on that date. Post a message on the project talk page with suggestions to inform other editors working on the project and complete steps 1 or 2 above to ensure an entry is available for an administrator to use for the \"On this day\" section on that date. Purpose of the staging area A list of events and images can be viewed by expanding the \u0027staging area\u0027 on the project page for each day, for example Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/January 1 (the staging area is not visible when transcluded onto another page, including the Main Page, due to \u003cnoinclude\u003e\u003c/noinclude\u003e tags). Some of these items (the \u0027eligible\u0027 section) are rotated in and out from year to year to form the group that is chosen for the \"On this day\" section on the Main Page for that day of the year. Other items are listed as \u0027ineligible\u0027 because the event and/or its selected article (boldfaced link) do not pass the selected anniversaries criteria (see below). Making improvements (as described in the section above) so that these entries become eligible is one of the valuable ways editors can contribute to the project. Reporting errors To report an error you noticed on the current main page or tomorrow\u0027s main page, please add it to the appropriate section on Wikipedia:Main Page/Errors. For other dates, please start a new discussion at Wikipedia Talk:Selected anniversaries. Admins: If the need arises to remove visible items from a page while it is on the Main Page, please move the items into the \u0027staging area\u0027 if possible, instead of outright deleting them, so they can prospectively be used again in the future. Steps for suggesting new listings Shortcut WP:OTDTENSEWP:OTDTENSE Be bold while improving this queue but please make sure you follow the selected anniversaries criteria below. Important: although anniversary listings on individual date articles are written in present tense, these selected anniversary listings should be written in past tense to help distinguish them from current events in \"In the news\" when displayed on the Main Page. A single sentence for each entry is preferable and the link to the selected article should be boldfaced. If you want to add an item to yesterday\u0027s, today\u0027s, or tomorrow\u0027s listings, you need to be an administrator because those pages are protected. If you\u0027re not an administrator, add them to the talk page, such as Wikipedia talk:Selected anniversaries/December 15. For unprotected days such as Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/December 17, go ahead and add them to the \"Staging area\" under the \"Eligible\" heading. If the hooks have already been swapped for the year and you would like to use the hook for the upcoming set, please contact the set swapper to arrange this.

Latsio regionınıñ memuriy merkezi ve vilâyet sastusına saip Roma territorial birlemini teşkil ete. Tiber(en) özeni yalısındadır. Roma territoriyasınıñ bir qısmı Vatikan kvazidevletine aittir. M.e. 753 senesi qurulğan Roma Avropanıñ eñ qadimiy şeerlerinden biri, qadimiy bir tsivilizatsiyanıñ paytahtıdır. Atta antiklik devirlerde (m.e. III asır) Romağa «Ebediy Şeer» (latince Roma Aeterna, Urbs Aeterna) dey ediler. Romanı birincilerden biri romalı şairi Albius Tibull (m.e. I asır) öz ekinci elegiyasında böyle adlandırğan edi. Romanıñ «ebediyligi» aqqında ğayeler qadimiy Roma tsivilizatsiyası yıqılğan soñ bile çoqça saqlanıp qaldı, bu ise uyğun epitetni zemaneviy tillerge ketirdi. Romağa «yedi bayırdaki şeer» de deyler. Başta qasabalar Palatin bayırında yerleşkenler, soñra qomşu bayırlar Kapitolium ve Kvirinal yerleştirildi. Biraz soñra soñki dört bayırda (Keliya, Aventina, Eskilin ve Viminale) qasabalar peyda oldı.

Vetrina Il teatro dell\u0027Artico della seconda guerra mondiale, parte del più vasto teatro scandinavo del secondo conflitto mondiale, vide contrapporsi da una parte le forze della Germania e della Finlandia (quest\u0027ultima fino all\u0027armistizio del 19 settembre 1944), e dall\u0027altra le forze degli Alleati, e in particolar modo quelle di Regno Unito, Unione Sovietica, Norvegia e Stati Uniti d\u0027America; le operazioni militari svoltesi al di sopra del circolo polare artico compresero attività terrestri, navali ed aeree. Le operazioni terrestri videro, nell\u0027aprile del 1940, le forze tedesche impossessarsi con un\u0027operazione anfibia dell\u0027importante porto norvegese di Narvik, affrontando poi con successo il contrattacco di un corpo di spedizione anglo-francese. Successivamente, a seguito dell\u0027avvio dell\u0027operazione Barbarossa nel giugno del 1941, truppe tedesche e finlandesi aprirono un fronte di guerra nel nord della Lapponia, puntando alla conquista dello strategico porto sovietico di Murmansk; dopo l\u0027abbandono dell\u0027alleanza con i tedeschi nel settembre del 1944, i finlandesi cooperarono coi sovietici per cacciare i reparti della Wehrmacht dalla Lapponia e dal nord della Norvegia. Contemporaneamente, unità speciali britanniche, appartenenti al corpo dei British Commandos, condussero una serie di incursioni contro le installazioni tedesche in Norvegia, mentre scontri minori e azioni su piccola scala finirono per interessare anche territori remoti come le isole Svalbard o la costa orientale della Groenlandia. A dispetto del clima ostile, le acque dell\u0027artico videro un\u0027intensa attività aeronavale durante quasi tutto l\u0027arco del conflitto: in particolare, la Kriegsmarine da un lato e la Royal Navy e le marine militari alleate (soprattutto la Flotta del Nord sovietica, la United States Navy e la Royal Canadian Navy) dall\u0027altro, supportate dalle rispettive forze aeree, ingaggiarono una serrata lotta lungo la rotta tra l\u0027Islanda e Murmansk, utilizzata dagli Alleati per far giungere in URSS massicci quantitativi di armi e materiale bellico ceduti ai sovietici nell\u0027ambito degli accordi Lend-Lease; ripetute furono anche le incursioni dei gruppi navali e delle forze aeree anglo-statunitensi contro le basi navali tedesche nel nord della Norvegia, volte alla caccia e alla distruzione delle principali unità da battaglia della Kriegsmarine. Leggi la voce · Tutte le voci in vetrina Voci di qualità La tartaruga del muschio carenata (Sternotherus carinatus Gray, 1855), è una tartaruga carnivora membro della famiglia Kinosternidae. Di piccole dimensioni, il carapace raggiunge solitamente una lunghezza compresa tra i 13 e i 16 cm. Il suo areale è compreso nel centro-sud degli Stati Uniti, dove, nonostante alcune minacce derivate dalle attività antropica, è classificata come una specie a basso rischio. In virtù delle piccole dimensioni, questo rettile è spesso venduto e allevato come animale da compagnia.

Embora os trabalhos individuais sejam às vezes citados como particularmente dignos de nota, o prêmio é baseado no conjunto da obra de um autor como um todo. A Academia Sueca é responsável por escolher o ganhador do prêmio e anunciar os nomes dos laureados, no início de outubro. É um dos cinco Prêmios Nobel estabelecidos pela vontade de Alfred Nobel em 1895. Em algumas ocasiões, o prêmio foi adiado para o ano seguinte. Não foi concedido em 2018, mas dois prêmios foram concedidos em 2019. (Artigo completo...)

Embora os trabalhos individuais sejam às vezes citados como particularmente dignos de nota, o prêmio é baseado no conjunto da obra de um autor como um todo. A Academia Sueca é responsável por escolher o ganhador do prêmio e anunciar os nomes dos laureados, no início de outubro. É um dos cinco Prêmios Nobel estabelecidos pela vontade de Alfred Nobel em 1895. Em algumas ocasiões, o prêmio foi adiado para o ano seguinte. Não foi concedido em 2018, mas dois prêmios foram concedidos em 2019. (Artigo completo...)

Its governing body is the Brisbane City Council. The LGAs in the other mainland state capitals (Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide) are generally responsible only for the central business districts and inner neighbourhoods of those cities. However, the City of Brisbane administers a significant portion of the Brisbane Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA), accounting for just under half its population. As such, it has a larger population than any other local government area in Australia.[3] The City of Brisbane was the first Australian LGA to reach a population of more than one million.[4] Its population is roughly equivalent to the populations of Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory combined. In 2016–2017, the council administered a budget of over $3 billion,[5] by far the largest budget compared to those of the City of Sydney and City of Melbourne LGAs.[6][7] The City derives from cities, towns and shires that merged in 1925. The main offices and central library of the council are at 266 George Street, also known as Brisbane Square. Brisbane City Hall houses the Council Chamber, the offices of the Lord Mayor and Deputy Mayor, meeting and reception rooms and the Museum of Brisbane. In the 2021 census, the City of Brisbane had a population of 1,242,825 people.[1] Suburbs [edit] The City of Brisbane includes the following settlements: Inner suburbs [edit] Bardon Bowen Hills Brisbane CBD East Brisbane Fortitude Valley Herston Highgate Hill Kangaroo Point Kelvin Grove New Farm Newstead Paddington Petrie Terrace Red Hill South Brisbane Spring Hill Teneriffe West End Woolloongabba Total: 19 Northern suburbs [edit] Albion Alderley Ascot Aspley Bald Hills Banyo Boondall Bracken Ridge Bridgeman Downs Brighton Brisbane Airport Carseldine Chermside Chermside West Clayfield Deagon Eagle Farm Everton Park Ferny Grove Fitzgibbon Gaythorne Geebung Gordon Park Grange Hamilton Hendra Kalinga Kedron Keperra Lutwyche McDowall Mitchelton Myrtletown Newmarket Northgate Nudgee Nudgee Beach Nundah Pinkenba Sandgate Shorncliffe Stafford Stafford Heights Taigum Virginia Wavell Heights Wilston Windsor Wooloowin Zillmere Total: 50 Southern suburbs [edit] Acacia Ridge Algester Annerley Archerfield Burbank Calamvale Coopers Plains Darra Doolandella Drewvale Durack Dutton Park Eight Mile Plains Ellen Grove Fairfield Forest Lake Greenslopes Heathwood Holland Park Holland Park West Inala Karawatha Kuraby Larapinta MacGregor Mackenzie Mansfield Moorooka Mount Gravatt Mount Gravatt East Nathan Pallara Parkinson Richlands Robertson Rochedale Rocklea Runcorn Salisbury Seventeen Mile Rocks Sinnamon Park Stones Corner Stretton Sumner Sunnybank Sunnybank Hills Tarragindi Tennyson Upper Mount Gravatt Wacol Willawong Wishart Yeerongpilly Yeronga Total: 54 Eastern suburbs [edit] Balmoral Belmont Bulimba Camp Hill Cannon Hill Carina Carina Heights Carindale Chandler Coorparoo Gumdale Hawthorne Hemmant Lota Lytton Manly Manly West Morningside Murarrie Norman Park Port of Brisbane Ransome Seven Hills Tingalpa Wakerley Wynnum Wynnum West Total: 27 Western suburbs [edit] Anstead Ashgrove Auchenflower Banks Creek Bellbowrie Brookfield Chapel Hill Chelmer Chuwar Corind",

Er ist mit einer Körperlänge von durchschnittlich 15 Zentimetern etwa so groß wie ein Haussperling, wirkt aber durch seine grazilere und schlankere Gestalt optisch größer als dieser. Der im Sommer in Mitteleuropa früher häufige, optisch unauffällige Vogel ist vor allem an Waldrändern und -lichtungen zu beobachten, da er als Bodenbrüter neben einem Bestand an hohen Bäumen und Sträuchern auch offene, mit hoher Vegetation bestandene Flächen benötigt. Er fällt dort vor allem durch seinen Gesang auf. Der Baumpieper ist ein Weitstreckenzieher, der in der Vegetationszone der Hochgras-Savannen West- und Ostafrikas überwintert. In Deutschland und der Schweiz steht der Baumpieper auf der Liste der bedrohten Singvögel und gilt auch in Kulturlandschaften als vom Aussterben bedroht. – Zum Artikel … Archiv Weitere exzellente und lesenswerte Artikel sowie informative Listen RSS-Feed Was geschah am 15.

Создать статью Справка Порталы Избранная статья Библиотеки Древнего Рима Реконструкция интерьера библиотеки Ульпия на форуме Траяна. Музей римской цивилизации Библиотеки в Древнем Риме появились относительно поздно, примерно ко II веку до н. э. Римское государство, в отличие от древнегреческих и эллинистических правительств, не интересовалось системой образования и накопления книг. Первые библиотеки в Риме были частными, их фонды составлялись из греческих книг, захваченных во время завоеваний. Только на рубеже новой эры императоры стали заботиться о библиотеках, финансировать их создание и копирование книг. Античные библиотеки представляли собой статусные учреждения, в которых хранились канонические наборы текстов, упоминаемые в источниках как военная добыча и предмет гордости правителей или частных владельцев. В ареале греческой культуры — с центрами в Афинах и Александрии — именно правитель (демократически избранный архонт, тиран или царь) осуществлял накопление эталонных литературных текстов, передаваемых от поколения к поколению. Даже глава философской школы ассоциировался с политической властью. Данную концепцию попытался воссоздать в Риме Юлий Цезарь, но неудачно. Создаваемые от времени Августа публичные библиотеки имели статус собственности римского народа и, по-видимому, предназначались не столько для сохранения и передачи письменных текстов, сколько для декламации общественно значимых и одобряемых императорами произведений. Предположительно все императорские библиотеки финансировались из фиска или эрария. В символическом смысле библиотеки выражали заботу императорской власти о высокой культуре (пайдейе), позволяя заявлять о Риме как центре цивилизации. Книжная культура Рима достаточно хорошо известна из литературных источников золотого века латинской литературы, сохранилась и единственная целостная библиотека того времени — на вилле Папирусов в Геркулануме. В I—III веках в Риме насчитывалось семь или девять библиотек, связанных с крупнейшими храмами и общественными пространствами, как минимум две из них включали секции латинской и греческой литературы. Согласно археологическим данным, фонды крупнейших библиотек могли составлять около 20 тысяч папирусных свитков.

Ταυρικὦν κλίματα)) — одно из названий исторического региона на юго-западе горного Крыма, либо его структурных подразделений, населённых, преимущественно готами. Климаты, как административные районы, управлялись топархами, которых иногда называли архонтами. Собственно климатами в Византийской империи называли самую мелкую административную единицу (нижнего уровня) в пограничных провинциях, управлявшуюся архонтами, потому к ним иногда применяли термин «архонтство». В случае средневековой Таврики топоним климаты, в разное время с различными уточнениями, применяли как синоним административной единицы верхнего уровня. С VII века это была область Дори — здесь локализовали Климаты Херсона. С VIII века и, возможно, до первой половины XIII века вместо Дори фигурировала Готия, или «Климаты Готии». Со второй половины VIII века и по 841 год Климаты находились под властью Хазарского каганата, сохранившего в них византийскую административную структуру. В 841 году Византия восстановила своё владычество, учредив в Таврике «фему пяти Климатов». В византийских документах название употреблялось до X века, в исторической литературе — до XIII века. Считается, что регион граничил с владениями Херсонеса, иногда юридически объединяясь в одну административную единицу. Некоторыми историками выдвигались версии о распространении понятия Климаты практически на весь горный Крым и крымскую часть Боспора, что противоречит прямым указаниям в имеющихся документах.

Τέχνη — Ιστορία — Επιστήμη — Τεχνολογία — Γεωγραφία Κατάλογος θεματικών πυλών Επιλεγμένο λήμμα Οι κυπριακές ομάδες ανδρών συμμετέχουν στις διοργανώσεις της ΟΥΕΦΑ από την περίοδο 1963-64. Είχε προηγηθεί η ένταξη της Κυπριακής Ομοσπονδίας Ποδοσφαίρου στην ευρωπαϊκή συνομοσπονδία το 1962. Οι κυπριακές ομάδες έχουν συμμετάσχει σε τέσσερις ευρωπαϊκές διοργανώσεις: Κύπελλο Πρωταθλητριών Ομάδων Ευρώπης (μετέπειτα Τσάμπιονς Λιγκ), Κύπελλο ΟΥΕΦΑ (μετέπειτα Γιουρόπα Λιγκ), Κύπελλο Κυπελλούχων Ευρώπης και Κυπέλλο Ιντερτότο. Συνολικά έχουν συμμετάσχει σε ευρωπαϊκές διοργανώσεις 16 διαφορετικές ομάδες. Τις πρώτες δεκαετίες οι κυπριακές ομάδες δεχόντουσαν βαριές ήττες. Στη συνέχεια τα αποτελέσματα τους βελτιώνονταν συνεχώς. Οι κυπριακές ομάδες κέρδιζαν προκρίσεις και επί ισχυρότερων αντιπάλων. Το 2008 μία κυπριακή ομάδα, η Ανόρθωση, πέτυχε την πρόκριση της σε ομίλους ευρωπαϊκής διοργάνωσης, και από τότε τουλάχιστον μία ομάδα συμμετέχει σε όμιλο κάθε χρόνο. Η σημαντικότερη επιτυχία αποτελεί η πρόκριση και συμμετοχή του ΑΠΟΕΛ στα προημιτελικά του Τσάμπιονς Λιγκ την περίοδο 2011-12. Ακολουθεί η παρουσία της ίδιας ομάδας στη φάση των 16 του Γιουρόπα Λιγκ την περίοδο 2016-17. Η θέση της Κύπρου στην κατάταξη της ΟΥΕΦΑ με το τέλος της περιόδου 2012-13 ήταν η 14η, η καλύτερη που είχε ποτέ. (Διαβάστε το υπόλοιπο λήμμα...) Άλλα προβεβλημένα λήμματα...

Ο Πραξιτέλης ήταν ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους γλύπτες της αρχαιότητας, ο πιο διάσημος των αττικών γλυπτών του 4ου αιώνα π.Χ. και ο πρώτος που φιλοτέχνησε τη γυμνή θηλυκή μορφή σε φυσικό μέγεθος; το Έσλινγκεν είναι πόλη στη νοτιοδυτική Γερμανία, γνωστή στην ευρύτερη περιοχή για το μεσαιωνικό χριστουγεννιάτικο παζάρι της; Οι Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες του Μόντρεαλ σημαδεύτηκαν από το μποϋκοτάζ των αφρικανικών χωρών που αντέδρασαν στην παρουσία της Νέας Ζηλανδίας; Αιτία, το γεγονός ότι η Νέα Ζηλανδία έστειλε την ομάδα ράγκμπι της σε τουρνουά της Νότιας Αφρικής, χώρα που ίσχυε η πολιτική του απαρτχάιντ.

It borders Delaware to its southeast, Maryland to its south, West Virginia to its southwest, Ohio and the Ohio River to its west, the Canadian province of Ontario to its northwest via Lake Erie, New York to its north, and the Delaware River and New Jersey to its east. Pennsylvania\u0027s most populous city is Philadelphia. The state capital is Harrisburg. Among all states, Pennsylvania is the fifth-most populous with over 13 million residents as of the 2020 United States census, the ninth-highest by population density, and the 33rd-largest by land area. The largest metropolitan statistical area is the southeastern Philadelphia metropolitan area, centered on Philadelphia, the state\u0027s most populous and nation\u0027s sixth-most populous city.

Pennsylvania played a vital and historic role in the American Revolution and the ultimately successful quest for independence from the British Empire, hosting the First and Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, the latter of which formed the Continental Army commanded by George Washington in 1775, during the American Revolutionary War, unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence the following year.[10] On December 12, 1787, Pennsylvania was the second state to ratify the U.S. Constitution, right after Delaware. The Battle of Gettysburg, fought in July 1863 around Gettysburg, was the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War with over 51,000 Union and Confederate casualties, and resulted in a repulsion of the Confederacy\u0027s invasion of the North.

Founded by antislavery Know Nothing and Republican Simon Cameron, it passed into control of his son J. Donald Cameron, later controlled by Matthew Quay and finally Boies Penrose. The organization was financially and fiscally conservative, favoring higher protective tariffs and representing business interests. The elder Cameron\u0027s leadership skills were contrasted with the weaker political abilities of his son Donald, and several Republican defeats resulted in a transfer of machine power into the hands of Quay, who utilized the machine\u0027s powers with shrewd effectiveness. The baton of machine boss was then passed for a final time to Penrose, whose death ended its power and influence. History and timeline [edit] Simon Cameron establishes the machine [edit] Simon Cameron, namesake of the machine The state Republican machine of Pennsylvania was first established by Simon Cameron,[4] originally a Jacksonian Democrat who became a Know Nothing and eventually joined the Republican Party. Cameron, who previously in 1845 organized a coalition of Whigs, anti-Catholic activists,[5] and protectionist Democrats that elected him to the Senate, rode the coattails of the rising Republican Party influence around 1860 to form the machine that would prove influential for decades to come.[6] Previously a businessman, Cameron wielded power over state jobs and contracts to exert and cement his influence after his election to the United States Senate in the 1866 elections.[4] Among patronage decisions, he transacted loans from Middletown Bank to loyal Republicans. Baton of machine boss handed from father to son [edit] In 1877, J. Donald Cameron became a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania following the resignation of his father. Despite obtaining such an important post in addition to assuming leadership of the elder Cameron\u0027s political machine (which resulted in effectively being the Pennsylvania Republican Party \"boss\"),[7] his political skills were lacking, in addition to charisma.[8] While a consistent party loyalist, Cameron seldom spoke on the Senate floor or introduced legislation.[7] Although generally quiet, Cameron was outspoken in his support for protective tariffs,[8] a position held by most Republicans. During the 1880 presidential election, Cameron served as the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Aligned with congressional conservative stalwarts led by Roscoe Conkling,[9] he supported nominating former president Grant to run for an unprecedented, non-consecutive third term.[10] Portrait of Don Cameron In 1882, factionalism divided the Pennsylvania GOP and handed a victory to Democrats when roughly 40,000 Liberal Republicans, pejoratively deemed \"Half-Breeds\" by the Republican machine, bolted from the party in the gubernatorial election that year to vote for an \"Independent Republican\" candidate.[7] Several years later in the mid-1880s, Cameron was replaced as machine leader by Matthew S. Quay, who proved to surpass the former in influence and capabilities.[8] The Federal Elections Bill of 1890 introduced by conservative Republican Massachusetts congressman Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., narrowly passed the House by a party-line vote and faced a blockade in the Senate. Western liberal Republicans who advocated bimetallism, later known for forming the Silver Republican Party, opposed the bill under the belief that the stance would draw support from Southern Democrats into their pro-free silver cause, while some Northern pro-business Republicans such as Cameron and Quay emphasized protective tariffs.[11] Although the Pennsylvania senatorial duo did not oppose the legislation, they prioritized the tariff issue and did comparably little to help pass the Lodge bill, which ultimately died as a result of the blockade. In the 1896–97 elections, Cameron declined to run for another term due to the increasing intraparty power of Quay.[12] Quay replaces Don Cameron as boss [edit] Amidst discord among the Pennsylvania GOP, Quay developed a shrewd strategy to prevent another party demise. He raided the state treasury, exerting sharp control over the office and dispensed patronage in the forms of loans to political allies.[13][14] Quay would state on the matter: I don\u0027t mind losing the governorship or a legislature now and then, but I always need the state treasuryship.

Protest did not resume. On 7 October 2020, the Supreme Court judged that Shaheen Bagh type protests, which occupy public places indefinitely, are not allowed. Lead figures Non-centralized leadership [a] Casualties Death 0 [b] Injuries 1 Arrested 10 [c] Location within Delhi Show map of Delhi Shaheen Bagh protest (India) Show map of India A peaceful sit-in protest in Delhi, India, began on 15 December 2019 and lasted until 24 March 2020. The protest was led by women who blocked a major road[d] at Shaheen Bagh using non-violent resistance 24×7.[10][11][12] Mainly consisting of Muslim women, the protest began in response to the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on 11 December 2019 and the ensuing police intervention against students at Jamia Millia Islamia who were opposing the Amendment. Protesters agitated against the citizenship issues of the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), in addition to police brutality, unemployment, and poverty, and for women\u0027s safety. The Delhi Police barricaded major roads in and around the area, affecting more than 100,000 vehicles a day and adding hours to some journeys. Following the North East Delhi riots, police presence in the area temporarily increased with over 1000 personnel being assigned to Shaheen Bagh. After the COVID-19 outbreak in India and subsequent government-enforced restrictions the protest continued for several days in a more controlled manner. Following the complete lockdown imposed in Delhi on 23 March 2020, the remaining protesters were arrested or forcefully removed from the site by the Delhi Police. The barricaded and tented venue drew large crowds with tens of thousands of protesters participating. Some days saw over 150,000 at the venue. The protest inspired similar copycat protests across the country, such as those in Gaya, Kolkata, Prayagraj, Mumbai and Bengaluru.[13][14] The leaderless protest became politicized and was generally against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. The blockade became a campaign issue in the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections, especially for the BJP. BJP\u0027s campaign was negative towards the Shaheen Bagh protests with a number of campaigners making controversial statements such as \"goli maaro\" (English: Shoot them). Some BJP campaigners promised to immediately remove the blockade after being voted into power and were accused by their opponents of prolonging the demonstration to agitate voters. BJP won an extra six seats as compared to the last election while Aam Aadmi Party retained a clear majority with 62 seats. A number of petitions were filed to stop the blockade. The Delhi High Court refused to hear the first two pleas and on 14 January 2020 declared the blockade to be a police matter. The Delhi Police said that they would not use force to end the blockade. A third petition highlighted the difficulty faced by students with upcoming board examinations. The matter reached the Supreme Court of India, which appointed three mediators to initiate conversations with the protesters regarding shifting to a location which wouldn\u0027t block a public place. In response to the batch of petitions filed against the protestors, the Supreme Court of India stated on 7 October 2020 that the \"indefinite\" occupation of public space for protest or expressing dissent was not acceptable. One of the Shaheen Bagh protestors, 82-year old Bilkis,[15] was listed in Time magazine\u0027s 100 most influential people of 2020, BBC\u0027s 100 Women and was also named as the \u0027Women of the Year\u0027 in the 2021 edition of The Muslim 500. Delhi Police labelled Sharjeel Imam as one of the \u0027masterminds\u0027 of the protest. While the protest was praised for a number of reasons some commentators called it a failure with regard to the main goal of revoking CAA.

Outras actividades do xogo inclúen a exploración, a recolección de recursos, a confección de obxectos e o combate. Dispón de varios modos de xogo, incluíndo un modo de supervivencia no que o xogador debe conseguir recursos para construír o mundo de xogo e manter a súa saúde, un modo creativo no que os recursos son ilimitados e o xogador ten a capacidade de voar, un modo de aventuras que permite xogar niveis e mapas creados por outros xogadores e un modo espectador no que os xogadores poden voar e observar o mundo pero sen interactuar con el. A versión para PC do xogo destaca pola súa comunidade de modding. Outros artigos destacados • Artigos de calidade Sobre Galicia Ricardo Courtier, nado na Coruña o 10 de marzo de 1865 e finado en Ourense o 10 de decembro de 1922, foi un músico e compositor galego. Nado nunha familia de músicos, é considerado o membro máis salientable da terceira xeración de músicos da saga Courtier. Logo de finalizar a súa formación instalouse na Pobra de Trives, onde foi director da banda de música. Foi precisamente nesta vila ourensá onde desenvolveu un intenso labor fundando diversas agrupacións e compoñendo obras que serían interpretadas por estas. Posteriormente trasladouse coa súa familia á cidade de Ourense, onde residiu ata o seu falecemento, e onde foi director da Banda de Música Municipal. A súa obra salienta pola influencia da música tradicional galega, con harmonías sinxelas e formas típicas da música popular. Ademais do seu labor como compositor, Ricardo Courtier realizou arranxos para as distintas agrupacións que liderou.

Nevyrábali sa len nádoby, ako sú džbány a nádoby na pitie a jedlo, ale i také predmety, ako veľké kade, pece, sarkofágy, kanvice, vedrá, panvice, mažiare na drvenie, kozmetické skrinky, hračky, sochy, sošky, architektonické ozdoby, lampy a dekoratívne predmety (či nádoby). Keramické výrobky sa používali tiež pri obchodovaní, v remeslách a verejnom živote, napríklad ako hlasovacie urny, vodné hodiny, odmerky na tekutiny či sypké látky. Keramické nádoby, napr. čiernofigúrové panathenajské amfory sa dávali ako ceny pre víťazov na hrách. O nevšednom keramickom tovare s umeleckým zdobením sa toho vie viac, lebo sa často zachoval v hrobkách relatívne nepoškodený. Menej vedomostí je o obyčajných každodenných predmetoch, napríklad používaných v kuchyni, aj keď boli vo všetkých obdobiach zrejme bežnejšie. Vo vývinovej línii (chronologicky) sa výzdoba starogréckej keramiky rozlišuje na geometrickú, orientalizujúcu, čiernofigúrovú, červenofigúrovú, na bielom podklade a neskorú. Grécke keramické nádoby svojou štýlovou rozmanitosťou a rozšírením po celom gréckom svete (a jeho okolí) spôsobili bádateľom nemálo starostí. Tvar (typ) nádoby sa ale niekedy dal určiť pomerne jednoducho, občas bol nejaký antický termín použitý na základe dohody. Avšak o známych názvoch niektorých tvarov nádob, väčšinou tu ide atickú okrasnú keramiku, sa už dnes vie, že sú nesprávne (niekedy sa totiž vyrábali aj novinky typov váz, podľa požiadavok užívateľa). Rovnaký tvar mohla mať i celkom prostá nádoba i nádoba krásne zdobená. Najbežnejším zdobeným typom nádob boli poháre. Niektoré tvary nádob sa vyrábali aj z iných materiálov, napríklad z kameňa či kovu. celý článok...

(WMF) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization headquartered in San Francisco, California, and registered there as a charitable foundation.[7] The Foundation is most known for being the host of Wikipedia, one of the most visited websites in the world. It also hosts fourteen related open collaboration projects, and supports the development of MediaWiki, the wiki software which underpins them all.[8][9][10] The foundation was established in 2003 in St. Petersburg, Florida by Jimmy Wales, as a non-profit way to fund Wikipedia and other wiki projects[2] which had previously been hosted by Bomis, Wales\u0027 for-profit company.[2] The Wikimedia Foundation provides the technical and organizational infrastructure to enable members of the public to develop wiki-based content in languages across the world.[11] The foundation does not write or curate any of the content on the projects themselves.[12] Instead, this is done by volunteer editors, such as the Wikipedians. However, it does collaborate with a network of individual volunteers and affiliated organizations, such as Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, user groups and other partners. The foundation finances itself mainly through millions of small donations from readers and editors, collected through email campaigns and annual fundraising banners placed on Wikipedia and its sister projects.[13] These are complemented by grants from philanthropic organizations and tech companies, and starting in 2022, by services income from Wikimedia Enterprise. As of 2023, it has employed over 700 staff and contractors, with net assets of $255 million and an endowment which has surpassed $100 million. History Further information: History of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger founded Wikipedia in 2001 as a feeder project to supplement Nupedia. The project was originally funded by Bomis, Wales\u0027s for-profit business, and edited by a rapidly growing community of volunteer editors. The early community discussed a variety of ways to support the ongoing costs of upkeep, and was broadly opposed to running ads on the site,[14] so the idea of setting up a charitable foundation gained prominence.[15] That addressed an open question of what entity should hold onto trademarks for the project. The Wikimedia Foundation was incorporated in St. Petersburg, Florida, on June 20, 2003.[2][16][17] A small fundraising campaign to keep the servers running was run in October 2003.[18] In 2005, the foundation was granted section 501(c)(3) status by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as a public charity, making donations to the foundation tax-deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.[19] Its National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 (Adult, Continuing education).[20][21] The foundation filed an application to trademark the name Wikipedia in the US to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on September 14, 2004. The mark was granted registration status on January 10, 2006. Trademark protection was accorded also by Japan on December 16, 2004, and by the European Union on January 20, 2005. Subsets of Wikipedia were already being distributed in book and DVD form, and there were discussions about licensing the logo and wordmark.[22] On December 11, 2006, the foundation\u0027s board noted that it could not become a membership organization, as initially planned but not implemented, due to an inability to meet the registration requirements of Florida statutory law. The bylaws were accordingly amended to remove all references to membership rights and activities.[23] In 2007, the foundation decided to move its headquarters from Florida to the San Francisco Bay Area. Considerations cited for choosing San Francisco were proximity to like-min",

The TAR is based on the AR-M1, produced by Bulgarian manufacturer Arsenal AD. Developed between 2011 and 2015, Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli (OFT) began manufacturing TARs in 2017. The TAR was developed to reduce dependence on imported AR-M1s under the Atmanirbhar Bharat self-reliance policy. The TAR has been adopted by most Indian law enforcement agencies. History [edit] Background [edit] Prior to the TAR\u0027s introduction, India largely used foreign-made AK-style rifles. Around 500,000 M1s were reportedly imported by India from Bulgaria in 2021 for use by the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) and Indian police forces.[4] As of May 2025, India is the second-largest arms importer after Ukraine, accounting for 8.3% of the arms trade, according to research data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.[5] To reduce dependence on importing small arms from other countries, part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat policy called for self-sufficiency to manufacture firearms in India.[6] OFT announced the manufacture of an indigenous AK-based assault rifle in 2011.[7][8] The AR was named Trichy after OFT to recognise the factory\u0027s contribution in developing and manufacturing the rifle.[9] Some TARs were made in 2012 to be tested.[10] These early TARs were tested by the Border Security Force (BSF), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Sashastra Seema Bal.[10] Development started in 2015[11] with a production line established in 2017.[12][13] That March, 200 TARs were acquired by the Chhattisgarh Police[14] as part of the 216th Ordnance Factories Day celebration.[15] Concerns were raised at the time, prior to manufacture, that OFT was experiencing manpower decline, leading to a decline of employees at the company.[16] The All India Defence Employees Federation, the Indian National Defence Workers\u0027 Federation, and the Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh stated their opposition to importing small arms with the unions hoping that more orders for the TAR would be approved, retaining employees at OFT.[16] A CISF officer practices with the TAR at a shooting range. Adoption [edit] In November 2017, the CRPF conducted field tests to determine the suitability of the TAR with 15,000 rounds fired[12] at the CRPF Academy in Kadarpur, Haryana with no reports of the rifle jamming.[17] Other tests conducted included the TAR being fired from mud, rain and saltwater and from being dropped to test reliability and accuracy.[18] 100 TARs were ordered afterwards.[18] In February 2018, further tests were conducted by the CRPF at Jagdalpur, Raipur, Guwahati and Srinagar with an order of 6,167 TARs placed afterwards.[12] At the time, the CRPF tested the Trichy with the Ghatak, the Joint Venture Protective Carbine and the INSAS1C.[19] In March 2020, the CRPF acquired the first 500 out of 6,167 TARs sold to them.[11] In January 2019, the TAR was delivered to the BSF, with its Additional Director General Nasir Kamal receiving the first rifle from the Ordnance Factory Board\u0027s Director General Saurabh Kumar.[3] It was reported in the same month that the Jharkhand Police would acquire TARs for anti-Naxalite operations.[20] The TAR was displayed for the first time at the Pragati Maidan in New Delhi for the 5th International Police Expo and the 4th India Homeland Security Expo.[21] In February 2020, the TAR was on public display at the Defence Expo at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.[22] It was reported at the time that the TAR was offered to the Indian Army.[22] OFT reported in March 2021 that around 11,500 TARs were supplied for a total of Rs 1.60 billion during fiscal year 2020–21.[23] In January 2021, the TriCa (Trichy Carbine) Carbine was unveiled.[2] Tests were conducted where 2,000 rounds were fired with no stoppages.[4] That August, OFT announced t",

At first a supporter of James Buchanan, whom he succeeded in the Senate when Buchanan became Secretary of State in 1845, Cameron broke with Buchanan and the Democrats by the 1850s. An opponent of slavery, he briefly joined the Know Nothings before winning another term in the Senate as a Republican in 1857. He helped nominate and elect Lincoln, but rumors of corruption surrounded him; it was with reluctance that Lincoln appointed him to the cabinet. He did not do well in his post, and Lincoln made him minister to Russia in 1862, a post he held briefly. He rebuilt his political machine in Pennsylvania, winning a third term in the Senate in 1867. After ten years he resigned, arranging the election of his son, Don Cameron, in his place. Simon Cameron lived to age 90; his machine dominated local politics until the 1920s. (Full article...)

Imaju distinktivan površinski uzorak traka ili točaka koje se može osjetiti pomoću bijelog štapa ili stopalom. Cilj im je voditi slabovidne osobe kroz prostor te ih upozoriti na nadolazeće puteve, prometnice ili ulice, kao i na potencijalno opasne promjene u površini ili nagibu tla. Prvi sustav taktilnih staza uveden je na pješačkim prijelazima i drugim opasnim prilazima cestama u Japanu 1960-ih. Ujedinjeno Kraljevstvo, Australija i SAD usvojili su standard 1990-ih godina. U Hrvatskoj su zakonski usvojene 2005. godine. Taktilne staze često se pogrešno percipiraju kao staze za bicikle ili romobile.

This took place during a Hanukkah celebration hosted by the Chabad of Bondi in which a thousand people were in attendance. Authorities declared it a terrorist incident, and numerous world leaders and news outlets described it as antisemitic. Sixteen people were killed, including a child and one of the two perpetrators, with the second shooter in custody. A bystander had intervened and disarmed one of the gunmen. Police said the alleged gunmen were father and son. Forty-two people, including at least two police officers, were injured and taken to various hospitals. The New South Wales Police Force responded to the incident, and police later found and removed a suspected homemade bomb from a car belonging to one of the shooters. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was a deliberate attack on Jewish people during the first day of Hanukkah. It is the deadliest mass shooting in Australia since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, and the deadliest terror incident in Australian history. Before the attack, Australia already had one of the strictest gun laws in the world. Background Bondi Beach is one of Australia\u0027s most popular seaside areas. It is located in Sydney\u0027s eastern suburbs; this area is known as the centre of the Jewish community of Sydney, which in turn is one of the two largest Jewish communities in Australia (the other being in Melbourne).[4] The Bondi area of Sydney had experienced recent heightened security concerns due to the Bondi Junction stabbings in April 2024.[5][6] Australia had experienced an increase in attacks on Jewish communities and individuals since the beginning of the Gaza war in October 2023.[7][8] In August 2024, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) lifted Australia\u0027s national terrorism threat level from \"possible\" to \"probable\", citing the risk of community tensions and political violence related to the Gaza war as one of the reasons for doing so.[9][10] The incident took place at an annual Chabad community event (\"Chanukah by the Sea\"), to celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah.[11][12] The event was held at Archer Park just east of the Bondi Pavilion, and was attended by nearly 1,000 people.[1] Before the attack, Australia already had one of the strictest gun laws in the world, following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. This made it harder to store guns and firearms.[13] Assault rifles, shotguns, and many semiautomatic rifles were banned.[citation needed] In spite of this, the number of firearms in Australia, and the number of people licensed to own them, had increased since the Port Arthur massacre. In New South Wales, the state where the shooting took place, there were 260,000 gun licences in 2025, up from 181,000 in 2001.[14][15] Attack 120m 131yds 3 2 1 1 Footbridge 2 Archer Park 3 Bondi Beach External videos Bondi Shooter disarmed by hero bystander Drone video allegedly shows final moments of Bondi Beach shooting People fleeing the scene of the terror attack Initial vi",

For other uses, see Wikipedia:1st (disambiguation). Shortcuts WP:YFAWP:YFA H:YFAH:YFA Writing an article Learn how you can create a Wikipedia article. This page in a nutshell: The topic of the article must be notable: it must have in-depth coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the topic. If you are connected to the topic, don\u0027t write about it. Find another topic instead. Make sure there isn\u0027t already an article about the topic. The article you write must include citations to the sources you used. Use your own words to write the article; you must not copy from sources word-for-word. Don\u0027t use large language models (LLMs) to write original content. New here? Creating an article is one of the more difficult tasks on Wikipedia, and you\u0027ll have a higher chance of success if you help out with other tasks first to learn more about how Wikipedia works.

Creating a new article is one of many ways to contribute to the encyclopedia, but can be difficult for new editors. We recommend looking at our introductory tutorials or contributing to Wikipedia to learn the basics about editing first. Working on existing articles is a great way to learn Wikipedia\u0027s protocols and style conventions; see the Task Center or your homepage for articles that need your assistance and tasks you can help out with. Before creating your first article, it\u0027s highly recommended to practice in your sandbox. Choose a topic supported by reliable, independent sources. Write in a neutral tone, avoid promotional language, and make sure all the information in the article is supported by your sources. If you\u0027re unsure, the Article Wizard can help guide you step-by-step through the process. Don\u0027t worry if it\u0027s not perfect—every experienced editor started with their first try! Once you are familiar with the basics of Wikipedia editing, this page will guide you through the process of creating your first article! Specifically, you will learn how to: Determine whether Wikipedia should have a new article on the given subject Identify and use reliable sources to support assertions in the article Create a draft of the article Submit the draft for publication into the encyclopedia itself The basics Further information: Wikipedia:Simplified ruleset, Wikipedia:Reliable sources, Wikipedia:Verifiability, Wikipedia:Citing sources, and Help:Find sources All new articles start by researching a topic using high-quality, published sources. Even if you\u0027re an expert on a topic, you can\u0027t just write what you know off the top of your head; published sources are needed. High-quality sources include books by reputable publishers, respected newspapers, peer-reviewed scientific and academic journals, and other sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. This may include some high-quality websites, but excludes personal and company websites, blogs, social media, and any site where the public can contribute, like forums and even Wikipedia itself. We summarize such high-quality, published sources in Wikipedia articles. That is all we do! Please make sure that everything you write on Wikipedia is based on such sources, and be sure to include inline citations along with the content you write. While primary sources can be used, they should be used sparingly and carefully, usually only to support basic facts. Primary sources do not contribute to establishing notability. Before you start writing Are you connected to the article topic? Further information: Wikipedia:Plain and simple conflict of interest guide and Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure If you have a personal or professional relationship with what you want to write about, it is best if you do not create the new article yourself. Editing with a conflict of interest, regardless of whether you feel you can do so neutrally, gives the appearance of bias and undermines public confidence in Wikipedia. If you create an article despite your conflict of interest, you must disclose your relationship and make sure that it is reviewed by another editor by submitting it via Articles for creation. If you have a financial conflict of interest in the topic (for example if you have been paid to edit it) you must make the required paid-cont",

He led the United States through the American Civil War, defeating the Confederate States and playing a major role in the abolition of slavery. Lincoln was born into poverty in Kentucky and raised on the frontier. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. representative. Angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which opened the territories to slavery, he became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, prompting a majority of slave states to begin to secede and form the Confederate States. A month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, starting the Civil War. As a moderate Republican, Lincoln had to navigate conflicting political opinions from contentious factions during the war effort. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of Southern ports. He suspended the writ of habeas corpus in April 1861, an action that Chief Justice Roger Taney found unconstitutional in Ex parte Merryman, and he averted war with Britain by defusing the Trent Affair. On January 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. On November 19, 1863, he delivered the Gettysburg Address, which became one of the most famous speeches in American history. He promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which, in 1865, abolished chattel slavery. Re-elected in 1864, he sought to heal the war-torn nation through Reconstruction. On April 14, 1865, five days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, Lincoln was attending a play at Ford\u0027s Theatre in Washington, D.C., when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. He is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.

English Wikisource has original text related to this article: 1 Maccabees Hanukkah table Hanukkah[d] (/ˈhænəkə/, /ˈhɑːnəkə/; חֲנֻכָּה‎ Ḥănukkā listenⓘ) is a Rabbinic Jewish festival commemorating the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple following the Jewish Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.[3][4] Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days,[5] starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from November 28 to December 27 in the Gregorian calendar. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash ( שַׁמָּשׁ‎, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.[6] It is the only Jewish holiday to begin in one month (Kislev) and end in another (Tevet) on the Hebrew calendar. Other Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[7][8] Originally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.[9] This chronological proximity also contributed to the practice of gift-giving among American Jews. Etymology [edit] The name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \" חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\", because on Hanukkah, the Maccabees Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[10][11] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[12] The name can be broken down into חנו כ״ה‎, \"[they] rested [on the] twenty-fifth\", referring to the fact that the Jews ceased fighting on the 25th day of Kislev, the day on which the holiday begins.[13] חינוך‎ Chinuch, from the same root, is the name for Jewish education, emphasizing ethical training and discipline. חנוכה‎ (Hanukkah) is also the Hebrew acronym for ח נרות והלכה כבית הלל‎ – \"Eight candles, and the halakha is according to the House of Hillel\". This is a reference to the disagreement between two rabbinical schools of thought – the House of Hillel and the House of Shammai – on the proper order in which to light the Hanukkah flames. Shammai opined that eight candles should be lit on the first night, seven on the second night, and so on down to one on the last night (because the miracle was greatest on the first day). Hillel argued in favor of starting with one candle and lighting an additional one every night, up to eight on the eighth night (because the miracle grew in greatness each day). Jewish law adopted the position of Hillel.[14] Psalm 30 is called שיר חנכת הבית‎ Shîr Ḥănukkāt HaBayit, \"the Song of the \u0027Dedication\u0027 of the House\", and is traditionally recited on Hanukkah. 25 (of Kislev) + 5 (Books of Torah) \u003d 30, which is the number of the song.

Избрана статија Пристаништето на Ница Ница — петти најнаселен град во Франција, по Париз, Марсеј, Лион и Тулуза. Урбаната област на Ница се протега надвор од административните граници на градот со население од околу еден милион и зафаќа површина од 721 км². Сместен на југоисточниот брег на Франција на Средоземното Море, Ница е вториот најголем француски град на средоземниот брег, веднаш зад Марсеј. Градот е наречен Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella на окситански), што означува Убавата Ница, што исто така е името на неофицијалната химна на Ница, напишана од Меника Рондели во 1912. Ница е главен град на департманот Приморски Алпи и втор најголем град во регионот Прованса-Алпи-Азурен Брег по Марсеј. Површината на денешна Ница се протега на „Тера Амата“, археолошко наоѓалиште во кое се најдени докази за многу рано користење на оганот. Околу 350 п.н.е., Грците од Марсеј основале постојана населба и ја нарекле Никаја, по божицата на победата Ника. Низ вековите, градот бил заземан многу пати од разни освојувачи. Неговата стратешка местоположба и пристаништето значајно придонеле за неговата поморска сила. Низ вековите бил владение на Савоја, потоа станал дел од Франција помеѓу 1792 и 1815, кога бил вратен на Пиемонт-Сардинија до неговото повторно припојување кон Франција во 1860. Природната убавина на Ница и нејзината умерена средоземна клима им го привлекло вниманието на богатите Англичани во втората половина на XVIII век, кога голем број на благороднички семејства ги поминувале нивните зими овде. Главното градско шеталиште крај морето, Англиската променада (Promenade des Anglais) го добило своето име во име на посетителите на градот. (Дознајте повеќе...) архива • критериуми На денешен ден...

According to a 2024 estimate by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the City of Gold Coast had a population of 681,389 people. It is the second-largest LGA in Australia by population, behind the City of Brisbane. The ABS-defined Gold Coast–Tweed Heads significant urban area (SUA) had a population of 750,997 people, and is the sixth-largest SUA in Australia. It is also the largest SUA in the country that is not a state or territory capital.[1] The Gold Coast has a diverse economy, with construction being its largest industry by output, generating $19 billion for the local economy in 2024.[2] In the same year, the city’s gross regional product was estimated at $49.46 billion, accounting for 9.5% of Queensland’s total economy.[3] The LGA was established in 1948 as the Town of South Coast, following the amalgamation of several local government areas: the Town of Southport, the Town of Coolangatta, and part of the Shire of Nerang. Immediately to the north, the remainder of the Shire of Nerang, along with the Shires of Coomera and Beenleigh and parts of the Shires of Tingalpa and Waterford, were combined to form the Shire of Albert.[4] The LGA was renamed the Town of Gold Coast in 1958,[5] and the following year, it became known as City of Gold Coast. Following a recommendation by the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, the Shire of Albert was absorbed into the City of Gold Coast in 1995, partially to resolve water supply rights disputes between the two councils.[6][7] In 2008, a section centered on the suburb of Beenleigh was transferred to Logan City to unify the area north of the Albert River.[8] The area is gazetted into 52 suburbs (urban areas) and 29 localities (rural areas);[9] they stretch from the Queensland state border to the south to the Albert River to the north, and from the Coral Sea to the east to the Gold Coast hinterland and Scenic Rim to the west.[10] The largest division is the Southern Moreton Bay Islands locality (83.9 km2); it is also the only unpopulated division. The smallest division is the suburb of Broadbeach (1.4 km2) and the largest division by population is Southport (36,786 people).

It is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south, respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean; to the state\u0027s north is the Torres Strait, separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea, and the Gulf of Carpentaria to the north-west. With an area of 1,723,030 square kilometres (665,270 sq mi), Queensland is the world\u0027s sixth-largest subdivision of any country on earth; it is larger than all but 16 countries. Due to its size, Queensland\u0027s geographical features and climates are diverse, and include tropical rainforests, rivers, coral reefs, mountain ranges and white sandy beaches in its tropical and sub-tropical coastal regions, as well as deserts and savanna in the semi-arid and desert climatic regions of its interior. Queensland has a population of over 5.5 million,[9] concentrated in South East Queensland, where nearly three in four reside. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia\u0027s third-largest city and comprising fully half of the state\u0027s population. Ten of Australia\u0027s thirty largest cities are located in Queensland, the largest outside Brisbane being the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns, Ipswich, and Toowoomba. 24.2% of the state\u0027s population were born overseas.[10] The state has the highest inter-state net migration in Australia.[11] Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians, with the Torres Strait Islands inhabited by Torres Strait Islanders.[12] Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, the first European to land in Australia, explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in 1606. In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1788, Arthur Phillip founded the colony of New South Wales, which included all of what is now Queensland. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades, and the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement was established at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. During the Australian frontier wars of the 19th century, colonists killed tens of thousands of Aboriginal people in Queensland while consolidating their control over the territory. On 6 June 1859 (now commemorated as Queensland Day), Queen Victoria signed the letters patent to establish the colony of Queensland, separating it from New South Wales and thereby establishing Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government. A large part of colonial Queensland\u0027s economy relied on blackbirded South Sea Islander slavery.[citation needed] Queensland was among the six colonies which became the founding states of Australia with Federation on 1 January 1901. Since the Bjelke-Petersen era of the late 20th century, Queensland has received a high level of internal migration from the other states and territories of Australia and remains a popular destination for interstate migration. Queensland has the third-largest economy among Australian states, with strengths in mining, agriculture, transportation, international education, insurance, and banking.

Rinktinė iliustracija Pandžširo slėnis, Afganistanas Projekto puslapis • Keisti Savaitės straipsnis Pirmojo pasaulinio karo metais Respublikos gatvė vokiečių okupacinės valdžios vadinta Stoties gatve Respublikos gatvė – viena pagrindinių Panevėžio miesto centro gatvių. Prasideda sankryžoje su Klaipėdos gatve ir tęsiasi 1,27 km šiaurės–šiaurės vakarų kryptimi iki Respublikos gatvės tilto. Gatvės tęsinys už tilto – Stoties gatvė. Beveik visa gatvės trasa patenka į saugomo kultūros paveldo objekto – Panevėžio miesto istorinės dalies – teritoriją, čia stovi daug svarbių miestui pastatų, nemaža jų dalis įrašyta į Kultūros vertybių registrą. Veikia Panevėžio miesto dailės galerija, Panevėžio apskrities Gabrielės Petkevičaitės-Bitės viešoji biblioteka, seniausias lietuviškas knygynas Lietuvoje, šiuolaikinio meno muziejus „Stasys Museum”, Juozo Balčikonio gimnazija ir kitos įstaigos. Gatvės atkarpa nuo J. Urbšio gatvės iki tilto kursuoja maršrutiniai miesto autobusai. Gatvė atsirado be plano. XVIII a. inventoriuose dar neminima, XIX a. pr. vadinta Kepėjų gatve. Iš pradžių buvusi kreiva, vieni namai stovėję arčiau, kiti – toliau nuo gatvės. Vėliau gatvė sutvarkyta. 1872 m. pirmajame projektiniame Panevėžio plane vadinama Bajorų gatve. Tęsėsi iki Šeduvos (dabar Vasario 16-osios) gatvės, toliau buvo dirbami laukai. Daugiau...

Keisti Savaitės iniciatyva Jonas Paulius I (lot. Johannes Paulus I, tikrasis vardas Albino Luciani; 1912 m. spalio 17 d. – 1978 m. rugsėjo 28 d.) – 263-asis popiežius, katalikų bažnyčios vadovas. Išrinktas popiežiumi 1978 m. rugpjūčio 26 d. Mirė po 33 dienų, tokiu būdu papildydamas trumpiausiai valdžiusių popiežių sąrašą. Jonas Paulius I – tai pirmasis popiežius, gimęs XX amžiuje ir paskutinis, miręs XX amžiuje. Italijoje jis prisimenamas kaip „Il Papa del Sorriso“ (Dievo šypsena). Tuo tarpu žurnalas „Time“ bei kiti leidiniai dėl trumpo valdymo laikotarpio popiežių vadino „Rugsėjo popiežiumi“. Albino Luciani gimė 1912 m. spalio 17 d. Forno di Kanalėje, Beluno provincijoje, šiaurės Italijoje, daugiavaikėje neturtingoje šeimoje. Tėvas Giovanni Luciani (1872?–1952) buvo nepataisomu socialistu ir antiklerikalu, o motina Bortola Tancon (1879?–1948) buvo karštai tikinti katalikė. Būtent jo motina ir kunigas Filippo Carli turėjo daugiausia įtakos jaunojo Albino tikėjimui ir vėlesniam gyvenimui. Be būsimojo popiežiaus, šeimoje augo sūnūs Federico (1915–1916) ir Edoardo (1917–2008) bei sesuo Antonia (1920–2009). Kartu su jais gyveno dvi seserys iš tėvo pirmosios santuokos.

Almennt spjall Hjálp! Hvernig skrifa ég grein? Grein mánaðarins Makt myrkranna Makt myrkranna er gotnesk hrollvekja eftir Valdimar Ásmundsson sem var auglýst sem þýðing úr ensku á skáldsögunni Drakúla eftir Bram Stoker. Makt myrkranna var í raun byggð á fyrri endursögn á Drakúla á sænsku eftir „A-e“, Mörkrets makter. Báðar endursagnirnar eru nokkuð ólíkar Drakúla á ensku og talið er að þær hafi verið byggðar á fyrri drögum Stokers að skáldsögunni. Makt myrkranna birtist sem framhaldssaga í blaðinu Fjallkonunni frá janúar 1900 til mars 1901. Valdimar Ásmundsson, sem var sagður þýðandi sögunnar, var eiginmaður Bríetar Bjarnhéðinsdóttur, þáverandi ritstjóra Fjallkonunnar. Árið 1901 gaf Valdimar Makt myrkranna út á bók í Reykjavík og sagði útgefendur vera „nokkra prentara“. Fyrsti hluti Maktar myrkranna, sem nær yfir blaðsíður 5–167, fjallar um ferð Tómasar Harkers (sem heitir Jonathan Harker í frumtexta Stokers) til hallar Drakúla í Sjöborgalandi en annar hlutinn er endursögn á síðari hlutum Drakúla. Bókinni fylgdi formáli sem sagður var ritaður af Bram Stoker í ágúst 1898, rúmu ári eftir að Drakúla var birt í Englandi í maí 1897.

A rajtaütésszerű akció során számos partvédelmi üteg, gyárépület, hajógyár, kereskedelmi hajó, jelzőállomás, vasútvonal és egyéb infrastrukturális építmény semmisült vagy rongálódott meg. Ezeken kívül több mint 300 civil épület is megsérült, közte több templom és hotel is a célt tévesztett lövedékek miatt, 120 civil életét veszítette és csaknem 600-an megsebesültek. A támadás nagy közfelháborodást keltett Nagy-Britanniában, egyfelől a német haditengerészet civil célpontok elleni szándékos támadása miatt, másrészt a brit haditengerészet tehetetlensége miatt. Ez volt az első alkalom a 17.századi angol–holland háborúk óta, hogy angol katonák hazai földön veszítették életüket, ellenséges harctevékenység következtében. A támadással egy időben jelentős hadmozdulatok zajlottak a nyílt tengeren is. A rajtaütést végrehajtó egységeket a Nyílttengeri Flotta egészének kellett volna biztosítani, a Dogger-pad közelében pozíciót foglalva. A támadás napjának éjszakáján a csatahajóflottát kísérő erők azonban több alkalommal tűzharcba kerültek brit rombolókkal, amiből Friedrich von Ingenohl tengernagy, német flottaparancsnok tévesen azt a következtetést vonta le, hogy az egész brit flotta a közelben tartózkodik, és a visszavonulás mellett döntött. Ezzel páratlan esélyt szalasztott el Németország számára, mivel a brit hírszerzés csak Hipper tengernagy felderítőerőinek bevetéséről szerzett tudomást, és ezért csak tíz kapitális hadihajót küldtek ki ezek elfogására. Ingenohl így nagy túlerővel szállhatott volna velük szembe, és sikere esetén kiegyenlíthette volna a két szemben álló flotta közötti különbséget a kapitális hadihajók (csatahajók és csatacirkálók) terén. Hasonlóan a britek is nagy lehetőséget szalasztottak el, amikor az angol partoktól az aknamezők közötti szűk átjárón át távozni igyekvő német hajókat kommunikációs problémák miatt nem sikerült elfogniuk. A német támadást a polgári áldozatok okán a brit propaganda a németek barbarizmusaként tálalta, a német tengerészeket Winston Churchill brit haditengerészeti miniszter „csecsemőgyilkosoknak” nevezte. A brit polgári áldozatok magas számához valójában nagy mértékben az járult hozzá, hogy Hartlepoolban a britek partvédelmi ütegeket helyeztek el sűrűn lakott településrészeken, közvetlenül lakóházak közelében, így azok leküzdését a polgári lakosság óhatatlanul megsínylette. A „Remember Scarborough” (Emlékezz Scarborough-ra!) szlogennel indított toborzási kampány eredményeként a támadás utáni hetekben több ezer brit lépett be önként a fegyveres erőkhöz, megbosszulandó a történteket. Ugyanakkor több brit lap felhívta a figyelmet arra, hogy mind a három településnek voltak katonai fontosságú létesítményei, ami miatt a németek jogszerűen indíthattak ellenük támadást.

For the space expedition, see Expedition 33 (ISS). 2025 video game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Developer Sandfall Interactive Publisher Kepler Interactive Director Guillaume Broche Producer François Meurisse Designers Guillaume Broche Michel Nohra Programmer Tom Guillermin Artist Nicholas Maxson-Francombe Writers Jennifer Svedberg-Yen Guillaume Broche Victor Deleard Composers Lorien Testard Alice Duport-Percier[a] Engine Unreal Engine 5 Platforms PlayStation 5 Windows Xbox Series X/S Release 24 April 2025 Genre Role-playing Mode Single-player Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 [b] is a 2025 role-playing video game developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler Interactive. Set in a dark fantasy Belle Époque setting, the game follows the volunteers of Expedition 33 as they set out to destroy the Paintress, a being causing the yearly Gommage, which erases those at or above an ever-decreasing age. In the game, the player controls a party of characters from a third-person perspective, exploring areas and engaging in combat. Its turn-based mechanics feature real-time aspects such as quick time events and timed actions in combat. The project originated in 2019 with Guillaume Broche, a Ubisoft employee, who left the following year during the COVID-19 pandemic to form Sandfall with friends and contacts, steadily establishing a core team of 30 developers that came to be supported by various production partners. Inspired by Japanese RPGs that shaped their youth such as the Final Fantasy and Persona series, the developers at Sandfall sought to create a high-fidelity turn-based role-playing game, which they felt was neglected by AAA studios. Development began with Unreal Engine 4 and later switched to Unreal Engine 5, providing rendering improvements. In January 2025, Story Kitchen announced a live-action adaptation of the game with developer Sandfall Interactive.[3] Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was released for PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S on 24 April 2025, and was available from day one on Xbox Game Pass. The game received universal acclaim from critics for its narrative, art direction, game direction, original soundtrack, gameplay and voice acting. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was nominated for and won several awards. It became the most awarded title at The Game Awards 2025 over 9 nominations and in the event\u0027s history, including Game of the Year at both it and the Golden Joystick Awards, and appeared on several publications\u0027 lists of best games of 2025. By October 2025, it had sold over 5 million units. Gameplay [edit] In this screenshot, Lune, Gustave, and Maelle are fighting against an enemy. On each turn, players can perform a basic melee attack, consume an item, use action points to shoot an enemy or use a skill. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a third-person turn-based role-playing game with real-time elements. The player controls a party of Expeditioners exploring a fantasy world. On their turns, players select whether to use an item, perform a melee attack to gain Ability Points, or spend accumulated Ability Points to use ranged attacks or Skills.[4] Ranged attacks are aimed freely, similar to a third-person shooter. When using a Skill, a quick time event can be completed for improved effects.[5] During enemy turns, the player can dodge, parry, or jump over attacks in real time to avoid damage.[6] Parrying requires more precise timing than dodging but provides Ability Points and the opportunity to counterattack.[7] A stamina system allows players to \"Break\" enemies, temporarily stunning them.[8] As players progress, the game introduces new attacks and parries, including Gradient Attacks, Gradient Counters, and Gradient Skills, all of which deal significant damage. The use of gradient attacks is monitored by the party using a shared gauge. It will slowly fill up when the party uses skills in combat.[9] The Expeditioners and enemies can also apply various status effects on each other, boosting or impairing either side\u0027s combat efficiency. Some enemies have weak points that can be targeted, or may be vulnerable to certain elemental attacks.[10] If the combat party is defeated, reserve characters may be called in to continue fighting. Combat ends when either side has no remaining combatants,[7] or when the player decides to flee the battlefield when they are facing minor enemies.[11] The game features six playable characters, with each having unique skill trees, weapons and gameplay mechanics. The mage Lune\u0027s Skills generate elemental \"Stains\", which can be spent to enhance her Skills. The fencer Maelle switches between Stances which alter her Skills, damage and defense. The scythe-wielding warrior Sciel can use a set of magical cards to apply and stack \"Foretell\" to enemies, and then consume them to inflict maximum damage on enemies.

Inleiding • Hulp • Kontak Gebruikersportaal • Voorbladartikels • Kategorieë • Stel ’n vraag Voorbladartikel Antinoös of Antinoüs (Grieks: Ἀντίνοος; omstreeks 111 – omstreeks 130) was \u0027n Griekse adolessent uit Bithynia en \u0027n gunsteling en minnaar van die Romeinse keiser Hadrianus. Na sy voortydige dood is Antinoös op Hadrianus se aandrang vergoddelik en aanbid in beide die Griekse Ooste en Latynse Weste; somtyds selfs as \u0027n god (Grieks: θεός, transliterasie: theós) en soms as \u0027n Griekse held (Grieks: ἥρως, transliterasie: hḗrōs). Daar is min bekend oor Antinoös se lewe, alhoewel dit bekend is dat hy gebore is in Claudiopolis (hedendaagse Bolu, Turkye), in die Romeinse provinsie Bithynia. Hy is waarskynlik in 123 bekend gestel aan Hadrianus, voordat hy geneem is na Italia vir sy hoër opvoeding. Teen 128 was hy Hadrianus se gunsteling, en hy is geneem op \u0027n toer deur die Romeinse Ryk as deel van Hadrianus se persoonlike gevolg. Antinoös het Hadrianus vergesel tydens sy bywoning van die jaarlikse Eleusiniese misterieë in Athene. Hy was ook saam met Hadrianus toe hy die Maroesiese leeu in Libië gedood het. Antinoös het in Oktober 130 te midde van geheimsinnige omstandighede gesterf, toe hy en Hadrianus deel was van \u0027n flottielje wat langs die Nyl gevaar het. Verskeie voorstelle is gemaak vir die oorsaak van sy dood, wat wissel van \u0027n toevallige verdrinking tot \u0027n opsetlike menslike opoffering of selfs selfmoord. Na sy dood het Hadrianus Antinoös as \u0027n god verklaar en \u0027n georganiseerde kultus gevestig wat toegewy was aan sy aanbidding en regdeur die Ryk versprei het. Hadrianus het die stad Antinoöpolis naby Antinoös se sterfplek gestig, wat \u0027n kultussentrum geword het vir die aanbidding van Osiris-Antinoös. Hadrianus het ook \u0027n spele gestig ter herdenking van Antinoös wat in beide Antinoöpolis en Athene plaasgevind het. Antinoös het \u0027n simbool geword van Hadrianus se drome van pan-Hellenisme. Die aanbidding van Antinoös het een van die mees blywende en gewildste kultusse van vergoddelikte mense in die Romeinse Ryk geword, en verskeie gebeurtenisse is nog lank na Hadrianus se afsterwe in sy naam gevestig. Antinoös het gevolglik \u0027n simbool van manlike homoseksualiteit in die Westerse kultuur geword en het verskyn in die werk van Oscar Wilde, Fernando Pessoa en Marguerite Yourcenar. ...lees verder In die nuus Lando Norris in 2025 Tydens die 2025 Formule Een-seisoen wen Lando Norris sy eerste Formule Een-wêreldbestuurderskampioenskapstitel, terwyl sy McLaren-span reeds in Oktober by die Singapoerse Grand Prix as die wêreldvervaardigerskampioen vir 2025 gekroon is. Binne enkele dae is die groepsloting vir drie vername, toekomstige sporttoernooie gehou: die T20I-wêreldbeker 2026 in Indië en Sri Lanka, die FIFA Sokker-Wêreldbekertoernooi in 2026 in Kanada, Meksiko en Amerika, asook die Rugbywêreldbeker 2027 wat in Australië sal plaasvind. Ná die afsluiting van die 30ste G20-spitsberaad in Johannesburg het Suid-Afrika sy G20-voorsitterskap aan die Verenigde State oorhandig.

Pik, ruots. Pikis järnvägsstation) on rantaradalla Kaarinan kaupungin Piikkiön taajamassa sijaitseva rautatieliikennepaikka. Siihen aikaisemmin kuuluneen vuonna 1898 rakennetun asemarakennuksen on suunnitellut Bruno Granholm. Asema sijaitsee 10 kilometrin päässä Paimion rautatieasemalta ja 13 kilometrin päässä Kupittaan rautatieasemalta. Piikkiön rautatieasema avattiin yleiselle liikenteelle 1. marraskuuta 1899. Aseman toiminta kesti henkilöliikenteessä yli 80 vuotta, kunnes 25. toukokuuta 1979 henkilöliikenne asemalla lakkautettiin. Ratapihan kauko-ohjauksen valmistuttua vuonna 1995 asema muutettiin kokonaan miehittämättömäksi. Piikkiön rautatieasema on enää tavaraliikenteen käytössä (jonkin verran puunkuormausta) sekä junakohtauspaikkana. Rautatieliikenteen ohjaus hoidetaan keskitetysti Helsingin kautta. Säännöllistä henkilöliikennettä asemalla ei enää ole. Joulukuusta 2016 lähtien asemarakennus on ollut yksityisomistuksessa.

Τέχνη — Ιστορία — Επιστήμη — Τεχνολογία — Γεωγραφία Κατάλογος θεματικών πυλών Επιλεγμένο λήμμα Οι κυπριακές ομάδες ανδρών συμμετέχουν στις διοργανώσεις της ΟΥΕΦΑ από την περίοδο 1963-64. Είχε προηγηθεί η ένταξη της Κυπριακής Ομοσπονδίας Ποδοσφαίρου στην ευρωπαϊκή συνομοσπονδία το 1962. Οι κυπριακές ομάδες έχουν συμμετάσχει σε τέσσερις ευρωπαϊκές διοργανώσεις: Κύπελλο Πρωταθλητριών Ομάδων Ευρώπης (μετέπειτα Τσάμπιονς Λιγκ), Κύπελλο ΟΥΕΦΑ (μετέπειτα Γιουρόπα Λιγκ), Κύπελλο Κυπελλούχων Ευρώπης και Κυπέλλο Ιντερτότο. Συνολικά έχουν συμμετάσχει σε ευρωπαϊκές διοργανώσεις 16 διαφορετικές ομάδες. Τις πρώτες δεκαετίες οι κυπριακές ομάδες δεχόντουσαν βαριές ήττες. Στη συνέχεια τα αποτελέσματα τους βελτιώνονταν συνεχώς. Οι κυπριακές ομάδες κέρδιζαν προκρίσεις και επί ισχυρότερων αντιπάλων. Το 2008 μία κυπριακή ομάδα, η Ανόρθωση, πέτυχε την πρόκριση της σε ομίλους ευρωπαϊκής διοργάνωσης, και από τότε τουλάχιστον μία ομάδα συμμετέχει σε όμιλο κάθε χρόνο. Η σημαντικότερη επιτυχία αποτελεί η πρόκριση και συμμετοχή του ΑΠΟΕΛ στα προημιτελικά του Τσάμπιονς Λιγκ την περίοδο 2011-12. Ακολουθεί η παρουσία της ίδιας ομάδας στη φάση των 16 του Γιουρόπα Λιγκ την περίοδο 2016-17. Η θέση της Κύπρου στην κατάταξη της ΟΥΕΦΑ με το τέλος της περιόδου 2012-13 ήταν η 14η, η καλύτερη που είχε ποτέ. (Διαβάστε το υπόλοιπο λήμμα...) Άλλα προβεβλημένα λήμματα...

She also wrote under the pseudonym of Caroline Harvey. Her novel Parson Harding\u0027s Daughter won the 1980 Romantic Novel of the Year Award by the Romantic Novelists\u0027 Association.[1] Early life [edit] Joanna Trollope was born on 9 December 1943 at her grandfather\u0027s rectory in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, England, the daughter of Rosemary Hodson and Arthur George Cecil Trollope.[2][3] Her father was an Oxford University classics graduate who became head of a small building society. Her mother was an artist and writer.[4] Her father was away for Second World War service in India when she was born; he returned when she was three. The family settled in Reigate, Surrey. Trollope had a younger brother and sister. She was educated at Reigate County School for Girls,[5] gaining a scholarship to St Hugh\u0027s College, Oxford, in 1961. She read English.[6] Her father was of the same family as the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope; she was his fifth-generation niece,[7] and was a cousin of the writer and broadcaster James Trollope. Of inheriting the name, she said: Oddly my name has been no professional help at all! It seems to have made no difference ... I admire him hugely, both for his benevolence and his enormous psychological perception.[8] Career [edit] From 1965 to 1967, she worked at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. While a civil servant, she researched Eastern Europe and the relations between China and the developing world.[9] From 1967 to 1979, she was employed in a number of teaching posts before she became a writer full-time in 1980. Trollope began writing historical romances under the pseudonym of Caroline Harvey, the first names of her father\u0027s parents. She formed the view that: \"It was the wrong genre for the time.\"[4] Encouraged by her second husband, Ian Curteis, she switched to the contemporary fiction for which she became known.[10] The Choir, published in 1987, was her first contemporary novel.[7] The Rector\u0027s Wife, published in 1991, displaced Jeffrey Archer from the top of the hardback bestseller lists. As an explanation, she said in 2006: \"except for thrillers there was nothing in the middle ground of the traditional novel, which is where I think I am.\"[4] In 1992, only Jilly Cooper\u0027s Polo and Archer\u0027s As the Crow Flies were stronger paperback bestsellers. \"I think my books are just the dear old traditional novel making a quiet comeback\", she told Geraldine Bedell in a 1993 interview for The Independent on Sunday.[5] Often described as Aga sagas, for their rural themes, only two of Trollope\u0027s novels (by 2006) actually feature an Aga.[4] The term\u0027s entry in The Oxford Companion to English Literature (2009) states that \"by no means all her work fits the generally comforting implications of the label\".[11] Rejecting the label as not being accurate, Trollope told Lisa Allardice, writing for The Guardian in 2006: \"Actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak. It\u0027s all rather patronising isn\u0027t it?\"[4] Allardice disputed the \"cosy reputation\" Trollope\u0027s books had acquired as her novels had \"tackled increasingly thorny issues including lesbianism, broken families and adoption, the mood growing darker with each novel.\"[4] Terence Blacker, who coined the term for Trollope\u0027s fiction in Publishing News in 1992,[11] admitted a decade later that he \"felt terribly guilty\" for lumbering Trollope with the phrase.[12][13] Trollope told Bedell in 1993 that her fiction does \"the things the traditional novel has always done\" by mirroring reality and exploring \"people\u0027s emotional lives\". Bedell observed that her novels until then were: never suburban, which is the real condition of most of England. Trollopian action takes place in large village houses, at vast kitchen tables; her doctors, vicars, solicitors and craft-gallery owners may worry about money, as her own parents did, but they don\u0027t have any social anxieties: they are invited for drinks at the big house as a matter of course. The books are as economically prestigious, and quite as aspirational in their own way, as the glitter blockbusters of the Eighties.[5] In 2009, she donated the short story The Piano Man to Oxfam\u0027s \u0027Ox-Tales\u0027 project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Trollope\u0027s story was published in the \u0027Water\u0027 collection.[14] She wrote the first novel in Harper Collins updating of the Jane Austen canon, The Austen Project. Her version of Sense and Sensibility was publishe",

Further information can be found at the DYK guidelines. Nominate an article Frequently asked questions [edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what\u0027s needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Because of WP:DYKTIMEOUT, a nomination should be reviewed within two months since the reviewer/promoter may agree to reject and close an unpromoted hook after that time has passed. Where is my hook? If you can\u0027t find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page or with the closer, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. If your nomination was promoted, but it hasn\u0027t reached th",

Првобитно је установљен као празник „на начин Сукота“, нису успостављене одговарајуће обавезе, што га чини релативно малим празником у строго вјерском смислу, али је достигао велики културни значај у Сјеверној Америци и другдје, посебно међу секуларним Јеврејима, због тога што се често дешава отприлике у исто вријеме када и Божић током празничне сезоне. Обиљежава се осам ноћи и дана, почевши од 25. дана кислева по хебрејском календару, који пада у периоду од краја новембра до краја децембра по грегоријанском календару. Слави се паљењем свијећа канделабра са девет грана, који се обично назива менора или ханукија. Једна грана се обично поставља изнад или испод других и њена свијећа се користи за паљење осталих осам. Та јединствена свијећа се зове шамаш (שמש‎, „послужитељ“). Сваке вечери шамаш пали још једну свијећу док се свих осам свијећа не упали заједно последње вечери фестивала. Друге свечаности за Хануку укључују пјевање пјесама, играње игре дрејдел и једење млијечне хране и хране на бази уља, као што су суфганијот крофне и врсте палачинки латкес. Од 1970-их, свјетски хасидски покрет Хабад је покренуо јавно паљење меноре на отвореним јавним мјестима у многим земљама.

Латинско име рода се односи на стари мит о овој птици као ноћној животињи која сиса козе и изазива престанак продукције млека. Постоји шест подврста које имају клинасту дистрибуцију, која се огледа у смањењу величине тела и светлијој обојености перја идући ка истоку ареала распрострањења. Све популације су миграторне и зиму проводе у субсахарској Африци. Његово криптично (камуфлажно) обојено перје омогућава му одличну заштиту током дана, када је птица практично неприметна док лежи непомично на земљи или грани. Код мужјака у лету се могу видети беле флеке по крилима и репу. Насељава сува, отворена станишта са проређеним стаблима и малим жбуновима, као што су вресишта, шумски прореди или тек посађена шума. Мужјак легња први долази на територију гнежђења и креће са карактеристичним оглашавањем, који неистренираном уху звучи као жаба. Он обилази територију и тера конкуренте карактеристичним звуком који прави ударајући крила о тело. Ударање крилима се може чути приликом спиралног лета удварања мужјака у присуству женке. Ова врста не гради гнездо, већ јаја (најчешће два) полаже директно на земљу. Инкубација траје 17—21 дан, а браон паперјасти младунци стасавају за 16—17 дана.

Од 1924. до распада Савеза 1991. године, носилац функције је био препознат као лидер Совјетског Савеза. Званично, генерални секретар је искључиво директно контролисао Комунистичку партију. Међутим, пошто је партија имала монопол на политичку власт, генерални секретар је дефакто имао извршну контролу над совјетском владом. Због тежине функције која је обликовала спољну и унутрашњу политику државе и примат над совјетском Комунистичком партијом, то је била дефакто највиша функција у Совјетском Савезу. Генерални секретар је председавао састанцима Извршног комитета или Политичког бироа (Политбиро), тела које је чинило 15–30 чланова. Састајао се по потреби недељно или пар пута месечно. Председавао је и Централним комитетом, органом величине око стотину до две хиљаде чланова. Заседао је пар пута годишње. Председавао је такође и конгресима, који су се одржавали, практично по потреби, у периоду од четири до пет година. У зависности од сложености одлуке коју је требало донети доносио ју је сам или на састанцима одговарајућих органа.

Genocid se sastojao od masovnih, planski provedenih ubistava zarobljenih bošnjačkih muškaraca i dječaka između 12 i 77 godina. Desio se u regionu Srebrenice, a izvršile su ga Vojska Republike Srpske pod komandom generala Ratka Mladića, te paravojna formacija \"Škorpioni\", zajedno s nekoliko stotina grčkih i ruskih dobrovoljaca. Događaj se smatra jednim od najvećih masakara u Evropi od Drugog svjetskog rata, u kojem je ubijeno više od 8000 ljudi. Masakr se generalno smatra jednim od najužasnijih događaja u savremenoj evropskoj historiji. General Ratko Mladić i grupa oficira Vojske Republike Srpske u međuvremenu su optuženi za ratne zločine, uključujući i genocid, pred Međunarodnim krivičnim sudom za bivšu Jugoslaviju (MKSJ). MKSJ je, između ostalog, donio pravosnažnu presudu u kojoj masakr u Srebrenici kvalificira kao čin genocida. Jednoglasnom presudom u slučaju Tužilac protiv Krstića 2004, Žalbeno vijeće Međunarodnog krivičnog suda za bivšu Jugoslaviju (MKSJ) presudilo je da zločin počinjen nad muškim stanovnicima enklave Srebrenica predstavlja genocid, zločin prema međunarodnom pravu. Presudu je podržao i Međunarodni sud pravde (ICJ) 2007. Zaključeno je da nasilno premještanje i zlostavljanje između 25.000 i 30.000 Bošnjakinja, djece i starijih osoba predstavlja genocid, zajedno sa ubistvima i razdvajanjem muškaraca koja su se desila tokom tog zločina.

Keisti Savaitės iniciatyva Jonas Paulius I (lot. Johannes Paulus I, tikrasis vardas Albino Luciani; 1912 m. spalio 17 d. – 1978 m. rugsėjo 28 d.) – 263-asis popiežius, katalikų bažnyčios vadovas. Išrinktas popiežiumi 1978 m. rugpjūčio 26 d. Mirė po 33 dienų, tokiu būdu papildydamas trumpiausiai valdžiusių popiežių sąrašą. Jonas Paulius I – tai pirmasis popiežius, gimęs XX amžiuje ir paskutinis, miręs XX amžiuje. Italijoje jis prisimenamas kaip „Il Papa del Sorriso“ (Dievo šypsena). Tuo tarpu žurnalas „Time“ bei kiti leidiniai dėl trumpo valdymo laikotarpio popiežių vadino „Rugsėjo popiežiumi“. Albino Luciani gimė 1912 m. spalio 17 d. Forno di Kanalėje, Beluno provincijoje, šiaurės Italijoje, daugiavaikėje neturtingoje šeimoje. Tėvas Giovanni Luciani (1872?–1952) buvo nepataisomu socialistu ir antiklerikalu, o motina Bortola Tancon (1879?–1948) buvo karštai tikinti katalikė. Būtent jo motina ir kunigas Filippo Carli turėjo daugiausia įtakos jaunojo Albino tikėjimui ir vėlesniam gyvenimui. Be būsimojo popiežiaus, šeimoje augo sūnūs Federico (1915–1916) ir Edoardo (1917–2008) bei sesuo Antonia (1920–2009). Kartu su jais gyveno dvi seserys iš tėvo pirmosios santuokos.

This unofficial \"State Shinto\" was thought by Allies to have been a major contributor to Japan\u0027s nationalistic and militant culture that led to World War II. The purpose of the directive was ostensibly based in ideas of freedom of religion and separation of church and state. History [edit] After the Second World War, it was generally understood by Allied students of Japanese culture and religion that Shinto in the form it took leading up to and during the war was social propaganda and was used as a tool of ultra-nationalism and a disguise for militarism.[citation needed] However, even though this support of Shinto was defined as non-religious propaganda[by whom?], in the Allied schools it was being taught as religious in nature. Thus, it was US policy regarding post-surrender Japan to abolish \"State Shinto,\" which was not and never had been a formal Imperial policy.[citation needed] The directive, SCAPIN 448, was drafted by the US military\u0027s expert on Japanese culture and religion, Lieutenant William K. Bunce, U.S.N.R.[2] and was issued on December 15, 1945, with the full title of \"Abolition of Governmental Sponsorship, Support, Perpetuation, Control, and Dissemination of State Shinto (Kokka Shinto, Jinja Shinto)\".[3] There were two translations given for the term \"State Shinto\": the first (\"Kokka Shinto\") was a neologism, and the second (\"Jinja Shinto\") referred to Shinto shrines, which up until 1945 had been secular wards of the state.[citation needed][4] According to the directive, State Shinto was to be stripped of public support and of its \"ultra-nationalistic and militaristic\" trappings. With the severing of its traditional state patronage, the Shinto establishment required privatization, and to that end any Shinto entity that had been dependent on public funding but not actually part of the secular administrative structure was to be assimilated either into what the directive calls \"Sect Shinto\" with no special privileges above the other popular faiths, or to be reformed, with conditions stipulating complete and permanent loss of government support, as \"Shrine Shinto,\" which was to be supported by voluntary private donation only.[non-primary source needed] No public funds whatsoever could therefore be used to support Shinto shrines or priests in any manner, nor any other entities that were at all associated with the Shinto religion. Public officials whose duties were in any way directly connected to Shinto religion were immediately to be terminated from office and their positions extinguished. Under the directive, Japan\u0027s Emperor could no longer report on public matters to his ancestors during official visits to the shrines. Instead, he was permitted to worship only non-officially and as a private individual, as all government officials were permitted to do. Any educational material considered to convey \"Shinto doctrine\" was to be categorically censored out of school textbooks, along with any content that at all suggested any positive effects of or justification for any of Japan\u0027s military actions in past wars. Public officials alike were forbidden any mention of anything that could be construed as being in any way religious, let alone Shinto, while performing duties in their official capacities. This was meant to stop the propagation of supposed \"militaristic and ultra-nationalistic ideology\" in particular, which was especially proscribed if conveyed in connection with Shinto or any other creed. These three alleged doctrines were specifically banned: (1) that the Emperor is superior to other rulers because he is descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu; (2) that the Japanese people are inherently superior to other peoples because of their special ancestry or heritage, or (3) that the Japanese islands are spiritually superior to other lands, because they are specially blessed by the Amaterasu. As a result of the directive, a stream of instructions from the government was issued covering a wide range of prohibitions concerning Japanese culture and rites.[citation needed] Pupils at state schools and children of pre-school age were prohibited from being taken on field trips to religious ",

Han räknas som en av Latinamerikas ledande romanförfattare och essäister. Han är en av de mest inflytelserika bland de författare som slog igenom under den latinamerikanska boomen under 1960- och 1970-talen. Vargas Llosa genombrott kom på 1960-talet med romanerna Staden och hundarna och Det gröna huset, där han skildrar och riktar kritik mot det peruanska samhället. Flera av hans böcker, bland andra Tant Julia och författaren och Pantaleón och soldatbordellen, har filmatiserats och hans böcker har varit internationellt framgångsrika. Vargas Llosa har verkat även som litteraturkritiker och journalist och har sedan 1980-talet varit aktiv politiker i Peru. Politiskt har Vargas Llosa rört sig från vänster till höger, och ställde upp som presidentkandidat för center-högerkoalitionen Frente Democrático i peruanska valet 1990. 2010 tilldelades han Nobelpriset i litteratur för sin \"kartläggning av maktens strukturer och knivskarpa bilder av individens motstånd, revolt och nederlag\". ► Läs mer Senast visade utmärkta artiklar: Sliver (singel) – Running Back to You – Ulriksdals slott Redigera • Utvalt innehåll på Wikipedia • Schema för dagens utmärkta artikel • Nomineringar Visste du att … ...

The reservation has a land area of 3,571.9 square miles (9,251.2 km2), twice the size of the U.S. State of Delaware, and has a population of 8,217 as of the 2010 census.[2] There are 15,568 enrolled members of the tribe.[3] The largest communities on the reservation are Fort Yates, Cannon Ball (both located in Northern Standing Rock) and McLaughlin (located in Southern Standing Rock). History [edit] Together with the Hunkpapa and Sihasapa bands, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is part of what was known as the Great Sioux Nation. The peoples were highly decentralized. In 1868 the lands of the Great Sioux Nation were reduced in the Fort Laramie Treaty to the east side of the Missouri River and the state line of South Dakota in the west. The Black Hills, considered by the Sioux to be sacred land, are located in the center of territory awarded to the tribe. In 1874, in direct violation of the treaty, General George A. Custer and his 7th Cavalry entered the Black Hills and discovered gold, starting a gold rush. The United States government wanted to buy or rent the Black Hills from the Lakota people, but led by their spiritual leader Sitting Bull, they refused to sell or rent their lands. The Great Sioux War of 1876 was a series of battles and negotiations that occurred between 1876 and 1877, with the Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne warring against the United States. Among the many battles and skirmishes of the war was the Battle of the Little Bighorn, often known as Custer\u0027s Last Stand, the most storied of the many encounters between the U.S. army and mounted Plains Native Americans. It was an overwhelming Native American victory. The U.S. with its superior resources was soon able to force the Native Americans to surrender, primarily by attacking and destroying their encampments and property. The Agreement of 1877 (19 Stat. 254, enacted February 28, 1877) officially annexed Sioux land and permanently established Native American reservations. Under the Agreement of 1877 the U.S. government took the Black Hills from the Sioux Nation.[6] In February 1890, the United States government broke another Lakota treaty by breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation, an area that formerly encompassed the majority of the state. It reduced it and divided it into five smaller reservations.[7] The government was accommodating white homesteaders from the eastern United States; in addition, it intended to \"break up tribal relationships\" and \"conform Indians to the white man\u0027s ways, peaceably if they will, or forcibly if they must\".[8] On the reduced reservations, the government allocated family units on 320-acre (1.3 km2) plots for individual households. Although the Lakota were historically a nomadic people living in tipis, and their Plains Native American culture was based strongly upon buffalo and horse culture, they were expected to farm and raise livestock. With the goal of assimilation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were forced to send their children to boarding schools; the schools taugh",

Coldplay es una banda británica de rock formada en Londres en 1997. Está compuesta por el vocalista y pianista Chris Martin, el guitarrista Jonny Buckland, el bajista Guy Berryman y el baterista Will Champion, además de Phil Harvey como su mánager. Sus integrantes se conocieron en el University College de Londres. Firmaron con Parlophone en 1999 y lanzaron su primer álbum, Parachutes (2000), que incluyó el sencillo «Yellow», con el que alcanzaron la fama. Su siguiente trabajo, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), logró también una gran acogida. X\u0026Y (2005) cerró lo que la banda consideraba una trilogía, y su sucesor, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), ganó el Grammy al mejor álbum de rock. Además, «Viva la vida» fue la primera canción de un grupo británico en alcanzar de manera simultánea el número uno en Estados Unidos y el Reino Unido en el siglo XXI. Coldplay amplió su repertorio con los discos Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019), Music of the Spheres (2021) y Moon Music (2024), en los que incorporaron influencias de la música electrónica, el R\u0026B, el ambient, la música disco, el funk, el góspel, el blues y el rock progresivo. Con más de 160 millones de álbumes vendidos en todo el mundo, Coldplay figura entre los artistas más exitosos de la historia. Fue la primera banda en alcanzar 90 millones de oyentes mensuales en Spotify y la cadena Fuse los incluyó entre los músicos más premiados, al mantener el récord de mayor número de premios Brit obtenidos por un grupo. En el Reino Unido, cuenta con tres de los cincuenta álbumes más vendidos, la mayor cantidad de discos que alcanzaron el primer puesto en la lista UK Albums Chart sin descender de las diez primeras posiciones y el reconocimiento como el conjunto más reproducido del siglo XXI en los medios británicos. Dos de sus actuaciones en directo figuran entre las más taquilleras y concurridas de todos los tiempos. La Industria Fonográfica Británica los describió como una de las bandas «más influyentes y pioneras» del mundo, mientras que el Salón de la Fama del Rock and Roll incluyó A Rush of Blood to the Head en su lista de los 200 discos definitivos y a «Yellow» en la exhibición Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Además de su carrera musical, el grupo ha destacado por su labor filantrópica, política y activista. Sin embargo, pese a sus indiscutibles éxitos, ciertos sectores de la crítica han puesto en entredicho su legado como icono cultural.

El hongo puede encontrarse en todos los continentes excepto en la Antártida. Es la especie tipo del género Sarcoscypha, la cual ha sido conocida con muchos nombres desde su primera aparición en la literatura científica en 1772. El análisis filogenético indica que la especie estaría muy relacionada con otras de Sarcoscypha que contienen numerosas gotitas de aceite en sus esporas, como la especie S. macaronesica, de las islas del Atlántico Norte.

Vorster alizaliwa mjini Hartenbos, Afrika Kusini, na alikulia katika familia ya wakulima. Alihitimu kutoka Chuo Kikuu cha Stellenbosch na alianza kujihusisha na siasa akiwa na umri mdogo, akijiunga na chama cha National Party. Alikuwa mfuasi mzito wa sera za ubaguzi wa rangi (Apartheid) na alishirikiana na viongozi wengine wa chama hicho kuendeleza utawala wa wazungu nchini Afrika Kusini. Kwa kipindi cha miaka kadhaa, Vorster alihudumu kama Waziri wa Usalama wa Ndani, ambapo aliwezesha kuimarisha sheria kali dhidi ya wapinzani wa serikali na kuendeleza sera za ubaguzi wa rangi. Alihusika katika utawala wa kihalifu dhidi ya makundi ya upinzani kama vile African National Congress (ANC), na alikuwa na ushawishi mkubwa katika kupambana na harakati za kupigania haki za kiraia za watu weusi. ►Soma zaidi Picha nzuri ya wiki Ziara ya Mwalimu Nyerere wa Tanzania mnamo Machi 12, 1985; Rais Nyerere akisikiliza maswali.

The system was operated by various companies under the names Southern Pacific Railroad, Southern Pacific Company and Southern Pacific Transportation Company. The original Southern Pacific began in 1865 as a land holding company. The last incarnation of the Southern Pacific, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, was founded in 1969 and assumed control of the Southern Pacific system. The Southern Pacific Transportation Company was acquired in 1996 by the Union Pacific Corporation and merged with their Union Pacific Railroad. The Southern Pacific legacy founded hospitals in San Francisco, Tucson, and Houston. In the 1970s, it also founded a telecommunications network with a state-of-the-art microwave and fiber optic backbone. This telecommunications network became part of Sprint, a company whose name came from the acronym for Southern Pacific Railroad Internal Networking Telephony.[1] History [edit] For broader coverage of this topic, see History of the Southern Pacific. \"Mr. Maguire\u0027s Stand on the Railroad Question,\" a caricature of Democratic gubernatorial candidate James G. Maguire published in the San Francisco Examiner depicting him triumphant over the political forces of the Southern Pacific, October 8, 1898 The original Southern Pacific Railroad was founded in San Francisco in 1865, by a group of businessmen led by Timothy Phelps with the aim of building a rail connection between San Francisco and San Diego, California. The company was purchased in September 1868 by a group of businessmen known as the Big Four: Charles Crocker, Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, Jr. and C. P. Huntington. (The Big Four had, in 1861, created the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR)[2]) It later acquired the routes of the Central Pacific Railroad in 1885 through leasing.[3][4][5] By 1900, the Southern Pacific system was a major railroad system incorporating many smaller companies, such as the Texas and New Orleans Railroad and Morgan\u0027s Louisiana and Texas Railroad. It extended from New Orleans through Texas to El Paso, across New Mexico and through Tucson, to Los Angeles, through most of California, including San Francisco and Sacramento. Central Pacific lines extended east across Nevada to Ogden, Utah, and reached north through Oregon to Portland. Other subsidiaries eventually included the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt, reporting marks SSW), El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, the Northwestern Pacific Railroad at 328 miles (528 km), the 1,331-mile (2,142 km) Southern Pacific Railroad of Mexico, and a variety of 3 ft (914 mm) narrow-gauge routes. The company was headquartered in the Flood Building in San Francisco\u0027s downtown shopping district in 1907. Ten years later, they moved into the historic 11-story, 65-metre (213 ft) Southern Pacific Building, also known as \"The Landmark\", located at One Market Street on the Embarcadero whose construction started in 1916.[6][7] At its completion, the building\u0027s first floor was devoted to retail except for the portion facing the rear courtyard (opening to Mission Street), which was reserved for Southern Pacific.[8] SP rented the second floor to a tenant, but occupied floors three through ten with various offices.[8] For nearly a century, the building was topped with a large sign emblazoned with a gothic \"S·P\" marking the company\u0027s San Francisco roots.[9] The SP was known for its mammoth back shops at Sacramento, California, which was one of the few in the country equipped to design and build locomotives on a large scale. Sacramento was among the top ten largest shops in the US, occupying 200 acres of land with dozens of buildings and an average employment of 3,000, peaking at 7,000 during World War II. Other major shop sites were located at Ogden, Utah; Houston, Texas; and Algiers, New Orleans. After the 1906 earthquake destr",

English is a West Germanic language that emerged in early medieval England and has since become a global lingua franca.[4][5][6] The namesake of the language is the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Britain after the end of Roman rule. English is the most spoken language in the world, primarily due to the global influences of the former British Empire (succeeded by the Commonwealth of Nations) and the United States. It is the most widely learned second language in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers. However, English is only the third-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.[3] English is either the official language, or one of the official languages, in 57 sovereign states and 30 dependent territories, making it the most geographically widespread language in the world. In the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, it is the dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law.[7] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. It has also become the de facto lingua franca of diplomacy, science, technology, international trade, logistics, tourism, aviation, entertainment, and the Internet.[8] Ethnologue estimated that there were over 1.4 billion speakers worldwide as of 2021[update].[3] Old English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons. Early inscriptions were written with runes before a Latin-based alphabet was adopted for longer texts. Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language.[9][10][11] An evolution of the Latin alphabet, the English alphabet, fully supplanted the runic alphabet by the High Middle Ages, coinciding with the emergence of Middle English in England under Norman control. Middle English borrowed vocabulary extensively from French dialects, which are the source of approximately 28 per cent of Modern English words, and from Latin, which is the source of an additional 28 per cent.[12] While Latin and the Romance languages are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole, English\u0027s grammar and phonology remain Germanic, as does most of its basic everyday vocabulary. Finally, Middle English transformed, in part through the Great Vowel Shift, into Modern English, which exists on a dialect continuum with Scots; it is next-most closely related to Low Saxon and Frisian. Classification English is a member of the Indo-European language family, belonging to the West Germanic branch of Germanic languages.[13] Owing to their descent from a shared ancestor language known as Proto-Germanic, English and other Germanic languages – which include Dutch, German, and Swedish[14] – have characteristic features in common, including a division of verbs into strong and weak classes, the use of modal verbs, and sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants known as Grimm\u0027s and Verner\u0027s laws.[15] Old English was one of several Ingvaeonic languages, which emerged from a dialect continuum spoken by West Germanic peoples during the 5th century in Frisia, on the coast of the North Sea. Old English emerged among the Ingvaeonic speakers on the British Isles following their migration there, while the other Ingvaeonic languages (Frisian and Old Low German) developed in parallel on the continent.[16] Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved i",

Ho sat som vald medlem av Venezuelas nasjonalforsamling frå 2011 til 2014. Machado var kandidat i presidentvalet i Venezuela i 2012, men tapte opposisjonsnominasjonen mot Henrique Capriles. Under protestane i Venezuela i 2014 var ho ein av hovudfigurane bak organiseringa av demonstrasjonane mot Maduro-regimet. Ho var førehandskandidat for Vente Venezuela i primærvala til Den einskaplege plattforma i 2023, men vart den 30. juni 2023 frådømd retten til å stille til val i 15 år av Riksrevisjonen i Venezuela. I 2025 vart Machado tildelt Nobels fredspris «for det utrettelege arbeidet sitt for å fremje demokratiske rettar for det venezuelanske folket og for kampen sin for ei rettferdig og fredeleg overgang frå diktatur til demokrati». Ho vart kåra til ei av BBC sine «100 Women» i 2018, og var på lista over Time Magazine sine 100 mest innverknadsrike personar i 2025. I 2024 mottok Machado Václav Havel-prisen for menneskerettar og Sakharovprisen (delt med González), for å representere venezuelanarar i kampen for demokrati.

For the 1989 album by Throwing Muses, see Hunkpapa (album). This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Hunkpapa\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Walking Shooter (Wah-Koo-Ta-Mon-Ih), 1872 Tribal Delegations to the Federal Government The Hunkpapa (Lakota: Húŋkpapȟa) are a Native American group, one of the seven council fires of the Lakota tribe. The name Húŋkpapȟa is a Lakota word, meaning \u0027Head of the Circle\u0027 (at one time, the tribe\u0027s name was represented in European-American records as Honkpapa). By tradition, the Húŋkpapȟa set up their lodges at the entryway to the circle of the Great Council when the Sioux met in convocation.[1] They speak Lakȟóta, one of the three dialects of the Sioux language. History in the 19th century [edit] Hunkpapa Lakota shield, 1885, made by Joseph No Two Horns (He Nupa Wanica), Metropolitan Museum of Art Seven hundred and fifty mounted Yankton, Yanktonai and Lakota joined six companies of the Sixth Infantry and 80 fur trappers in an attack on an Arikara Indian village at Grand River (now South Dakota) in August 1823, named the Arikara War. Members of the Lakota, a part of them \"Ankpapat\", were the first Native Americans to fight in the American Indian Wars alongside US forces west of the Missouri.[2] They may have formed as a tribe within the Lakota relatively recently, as the first mention of the Hunkpapa in European-American historical records was from a treaty of 1825. By signing the 1825 treaty, the Hunkpapa and the United States committed themselves to keep up the \"friendship which has heretofore existed\". With their x-mark, the chiefs also recognized the supremacy of the United States.[3] It is not certain whether they really understood the text in the document. The US representatives gave a medal to Little White Bear, who they understood was the principal Hunkpapa chief; they did not realize how decentralized Native American authority was.[4] With the Indian Vaccination Act of 1832, the United States assumed responsibility for the inoculation of the Indians against smallpox. Some visiting Hunkpapa may have benefitted from Dr. M. Martin\u0027s inoculation of about 900 southern Lakota (no divisions named) at the head of Medicine Creek that autumn.[5] When smallpox struck in 1837, it hit the Hunkpapa as the northernmost Lakota division. The loss, however, may have been fewer than one hundred people.[6] Overall, the Hunkpapa seem to have suffered less from new diseases than many other tribes did.[7] The boundaries for the Lakota Indian territory were defined in the general peace treaty negotiated near Fort Laramie in the summer of 1851. Leaders of eight different tribes, often at odds with each other and each claiming large territories, signed the treaty. The United States was a ninth party to it. The Crow Indian territory included a tract of land north of the Yellowstone, while the Little Bighorn River ran through the heartland of the Crow country (now Montana). The treaty defines the land of the Arikara, the Hidatsa and the Mandan as a mutual area north of Heart River, partly encircled by the Missouri (now North Dakota).[8] Soon enough the Hunkpapa and other Sioux attacked the Arikara and the two other so-called village tribes, just as they had done in the past. By 1854, these three smallpox-devastated tribes called for protection from the U.S. Army, and they would repeatedly do so almost to the end of inter-tribal warfare.[9] Eventually the Hunkpapa and other Lakota took control of the three tribes\u0027 area north of Heart River, forcing the village people to live in Like a Fishhook Village outside their treaty land. The Lakota were largely in control of the occupied area to 1876–1877.[10] The United States Army General Warren estimated the population of the Hunkpapa Lakota at about 2920 in 1855. He described their territory as ranging \"from the Big Cheyenne up to the Yellowstone, and west to the Black Hills. He states that they formerly intermarried extensively with the Cheyenne.\" He noted that they raided settlers along the Platte River.[1] In addition to dealing with warfare, they suffered considerable losses due to contact with Europeans and contracting of Eurasian infectious diseases to which they had no immunity. The Hunkpapa gave some of their remote relatives among the Santee Sioux armed support during a large-scale battle near Killdeer Mountain in 1864 with U.S. troops led by General A. Sully.[11] The Great Sioux Reservation was established with a new treaty in 1868.[12] The Lakota agreed to the construction of \"any railroad\" outside their reservation. The United St",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia English writer and critic (1741–1810) Sarah Trimmer Portrait of Sarah Trimmer, 1798 Born (1741-01-06)6 January 1741 Ipswich, Suffolk, England Died 15 December 1810(1810-12-15) (aged 69) Brentford, London, England Occupation Writer Sarah Trimmer (née Kirby; 6 January 1741 – 15 December 1810) was an English writer and critic of 18th-century British children\u0027s literature, as well as an educational reformer. Her periodical, The Guardian of Education, helped to define the emerging genre by seriously reviewing children\u0027s literature for the first time; it also provided the first history of children\u0027s literature, establishing a canon of the early landmarks of the genre that scholars still use today. Trimmer\u0027s most popular children\u0027s book, Fabulous Histories, inspired numerous children\u0027s animal stories and remained in print for over a century. Trimmer was also an active philanthropist. She founded several Sunday schools and charity schools in her parish. To further these educational projects, she wrote textbooks and manuals for women interested in starting their own schools. Trimmer\u0027s efforts inspired other women, such as Hannah More, to establish Sunday school programmes and to write for children and the poor. Trimmer\u0027s works are dedicated to maintaining many aspects of the social and political status quo. As a high church Anglican, she was intent on promoting the established Church of England and on teaching young children and the poor the doctrines of Christianity. Her writings outlined the benefits of social hierarchy, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. Yet, while supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and the family. Early life [edit] Sarah Trimmer was born on 6 January 1741 in Ipswich, England, to Joshua Kirby and Sarah (née Bull); her father was a noted artist and served as president of the Society of Artists of Great Britain. Trimmer had one younger brother, William; she was apparently the better writer, for she would sometimes compose his school essays for him.[1] As a young girl, Trimmer attended Mrs. Justiner\u0027s boarding school in Ipswich, an experience she always remembered fondly.[2] In 1755, the family moved to London when her father, who had written several important works on perspective, became the tutor of perspective to the Prince of Wales.[3] Because of her father\u0027s connections within the artistic community, Trimmer was able to meet the painters William Hogarth and Thomas Gainsborough as well as the by-then legendary writer and critic Samuel Johnson. She made a favourable impression on Johnson when she immediately produced her pocket copy of John Milton\u0027s Paradise Lost (1667) to help settle a dispute between her father and Johnson over a particular passage. Johnson, delighted that she admired Milton enough to carry his works with her at all times, \"subsequently invited her to his house and presented her with a volume of his famous periodical The Rambler\".[4] In 1759, at the urging of his former pupil the Prince of Wales (soon to be George III), her father was made Clerk of the Works to the Royal Household at Kew Palace and the family moved to Kew.[5] There she met James Trimmer, whom she married on 20 September 1762 at St Mary, Ealing; after their marriage, the couple moved to Old Brentford.[6] Motherhood and philanthropy [edit] Sarah Trimmer\u0027s Sunday School in Brentford Trimmer was close to her parents; after her marriage, she walked to visit her father every day, later accompanied by her eldest children. She and her husband had 12 children in all—six boys and six girls. Trimmer was responsible for her children\u0027s education and it was the combination of her duties as a mother and a teacher that initially sparked her interest in education.[7] Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer also became active in the Sunday school movement, founding the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She and two of the ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighbourhood.[8] Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer\u0027s Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil.[8] The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls.[8] While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately.[9] The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—\"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desire",

A rajtaütésszerű akció során számos partvédelmi üteg, gyárépület, hajógyár, kereskedelmi hajó, jelzőállomás, vasútvonal és egyéb infrastrukturális építmény semmisült vagy rongálódott meg. Ezeken kívül több mint 300 civil épület is megsérült, közte több templom és hotel is a célt tévesztett lövedékek miatt, 120 civil életét veszítette és csaknem 600-an megsebesültek. A támadás nagy közfelháborodást keltett Nagy-Britanniában, egyfelől a német haditengerészet civil célpontok elleni szándékos támadása miatt, másrészt a brit haditengerészet tehetetlensége miatt. Ez volt az első alkalom a 17.századi angol–holland háborúk óta, hogy angol katonák hazai földön veszítették életüket, ellenséges harctevékenység következtében. A támadással egy időben jelentős hadmozdulatok zajlottak a nyílt tengeren is. A rajtaütést végrehajtó egységeket a Nyílttengeri Flotta egészének kellett volna biztosítani, a Dogger-pad közelében pozíciót foglalva. A támadás napjának éjszakáján a csatahajóflottát kísérő erők azonban több alkalommal tűzharcba kerültek brit rombolókkal, amiből Friedrich von Ingenohl tengernagy, német flottaparancsnok tévesen azt a következtetést vonta le, hogy az egész brit flotta a közelben tartózkodik, és a visszavonulás mellett döntött. Ezzel páratlan esélyt szalasztott el Németország számára, mivel a brit hírszerzés csak Hipper tengernagy felderítőerőinek bevetéséről szerzett tudomást, és ezért csak tíz kapitális hadihajót küldtek ki ezek elfogására. Ingenohl így nagy túlerővel szállhatott volna velük szembe, és sikere esetén kiegyenlíthette volna a két szemben álló flotta közötti különbséget a kapitális hadihajók (csatahajók és csatacirkálók) terén. Hasonlóan a britek is nagy lehetőséget szalasztottak el, amikor az angol partoktól az aknamezők közötti szűk átjárón át távozni igyekvő német hajókat kommunikációs problémák miatt nem sikerült elfogniuk. A német támadást a polgári áldozatok okán a brit propaganda a németek barbarizmusaként tálalta, a német tengerészeket Winston Churchill brit haditengerészeti miniszter „csecsemőgyilkosoknak” nevezte. A brit polgári áldozatok magas számához valójában nagy mértékben az járult hozzá, hogy Hartlepoolban a britek partvédelmi ütegeket helyeztek el sűrűn lakott településrészeken, közvetlenül lakóházak közelében, így azok leküzdését a polgári lakosság óhatatlanul megsínylette. A „Remember Scarborough” (Emlékezz Scarborough-ra!) szlogennel indított toborzási kampány eredményeként a támadás utáni hetekben több ezer brit lépett be önként a fegyveres erőkhöz, megbosszulandó a történteket. Ugyanakkor több brit lap felhívta a figyelmet arra, hogy mind a három településnek voltak katonai fontosságú létesítményei, ami miatt a németek jogszerűen indíthattak ellenük támadást.

This timeline is a dynamic and fluid list, and as such may never satisfy criteria of completeness. Moreover, some events may only be fully understood and/or discovered in retrospect. January [edit] 1 January [edit] The Joint Darfur Force (JDF) said it had killed 462 Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighters including six commanders in a failed attack on Al-Malha, North Darfur. In addition, three vehicles were destroyed. The remaining unit under Ali Rizqallah Al-Safana retreated.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia American lawyer (1942–2025) For American professor of classics, see Gerald Michael Browne. Gerald Michael Brown (November 3, 1942 – October 6, 2025) was an American gaming regulator in New Jersey who became a lawyer for the gaming industry, and was the chief executive officer of Foxwoods Resort Casino. Early life and education [edit] Born on November 3, 1942, in Orange, New Jersey, Brown graduated from St. Benedict\u0027s Preparatory School, before earning degrees at Franciscan University of Steubenville and the Seton Hall University School of Law, later serving in the United States Army during the Vietnam War.[1] Career [edit] He began his legal career in 1970 as an assistant prosecutor in Essex County, New Jersey.[2] As assistant state attorney general in a 1980 case, Brown was the lead prosecutor and obtained the convictions of four members of the Genovese crime family on charges including extortion, loan-sharking and robbery, saying that the verdict demonstrated that the Mafia isn\u0027t merely \"a figment of Hollywood\u0027s imagination.\"[3] One of the defendants gave him credit for his legal skills, telling Brown to reach out \u0027If you ever decide to come over to the other side.\"[4] At a 1979 hearing of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, where Resorts International was seeking approval of the first permanent casino license in Atlantic City, New Jersey, he was asked by a commissioner if the casino operator or its management had any connection to organized crime, to which Brown responded \"not at the present time, no\".[5] He served from 1980 to 1982 as director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, which oversees the integrity of the state\u0027s casinos and gambling operations, after which he operated a law practice in Atlantic City that focused on gambling regulation.[2][6] In 1993, he was hired by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe to develop and expand what was then known as Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo \u0026 Casino on their reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut, expanding it into the Foxwoods Resort Casino.[7] With the state of Connecticut facing financial challenges, he was able to make a deal through the offices of governor Lowell P. Weicker under which the casino would gain authorization to install slot machines at its casino in exchange for the state given 25% of the take, with $100 million a year in revenue guaranteed on an annual basis.[4] The addition of slot machines helped fund a major expansion announced in 1993, that would add a combination 3,000-seat bingo hall / boxing arena / concert hall covering 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2) that would make Foxwoods the largest casino in the country.[8] A resident of Sea Girt, New Jersey, he earned $1.5 million a year while he ran what was considered one of the country\u0027s most profitable casinos, before leaving in 1997 in a dispute with the casino\u0027s owners related to a perceived conflict of interest that arose after he bought stock in one of the casino\u0027s vendors.[4][9] As president and part owner of Manhattan Cruises in 1998, his short-lived company offered overnight casino cruises to nowhere from New York City aboard the Edinburgh Castle.[1][10] Death [edit] Brown died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on October 6, 2025, at the age of 82.[11][12] References [edit] ^ a b Roberts, Sam. \"G. Michael Brown, Who Regulated and Then Ran Casinos, Dies at 82\", The New York Times, October 23, 2025.

Coldplay es una banda británica de rock formada en Londres en 1997. Está compuesta por el vocalista y pianista Chris Martin, el guitarrista Jonny Buckland, el bajista Guy Berryman y el baterista Will Champion, además de Phil Harvey como su mánager. Sus integrantes se conocieron en el University College de Londres. Firmaron con Parlophone en 1999 y lanzaron su primer álbum, Parachutes (2000), que incluyó el sencillo «Yellow», con el que alcanzaron la fama. Su siguiente trabajo, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), logró también una gran acogida. X\u0026Y (2005) cerró lo que la banda consideraba una trilogía, y su sucesor, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), ganó el Grammy al mejor álbum de rock. Además, «Viva la vida» fue la primera canción de un grupo británico en alcanzar de manera simultánea el número uno en Estados Unidos y el Reino Unido en el siglo XXI. Coldplay amplió su repertorio con los discos Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019), Music of the Spheres (2021) y Moon Music (2024), en los que incorporaron influencias de la música electrónica, el R\u0026B, el ambient, la música disco, el funk, el góspel, el blues y el rock progresivo. Con más de 160 millones de álbumes vendidos en todo el mundo, Coldplay figura entre los artistas más exitosos de la historia. Fue la primera banda en alcanzar 90 millones de oyentes mensuales en Spotify y la cadena Fuse los incluyó entre los músicos más premiados, al mantener el récord de mayor número de premios Brit obtenidos por un grupo. En el Reino Unido, cuenta con tres de los cincuenta álbumes más vendidos, la mayor cantidad de discos que alcanzaron el primer puesto en la lista UK Albums Chart sin descender de las diez primeras posiciones y el reconocimiento como el conjunto más reproducido del siglo XXI en los medios británicos. Dos de sus actuaciones en directo figuran entre las más taquilleras y concurridas de todos los tiempos. La Industria Fonográfica Británica los describió como una de las bandas «más influyentes y pioneras» del mundo, mientras que el Salón de la Fama del Rock and Roll incluyó A Rush of Blood to the Head en su lista de los 200 discos definitivos y a «Yellow» en la exhibición Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.

El hongo puede encontrarse en todos los continentes excepto en la Antártida. Es la especie tipo del género Sarcoscypha, la cual ha sido conocida con muchos nombres desde su primera aparición en la literatura científica en 1772. El análisis filogenético indica que la especie estaría muy relacionada con otras de Sarcoscypha que contienen numerosas gotitas de aceite en sus esporas, como la especie S. macaronesica, de las islas del Atlántico Norte.

Its catchment lies within the Gold Coast and Scenic Rim Region local government areas and covers an area of 782 square kilometres (302 sq mi). The river provides potable water for the town of Beaudesert. Course and features [edit] Formed by the confluence of the Right and Left Branches of the river that begin in the Lamington National Park and drain the northern slopes of the Border Ranges within the Great Dividing Range, the Albert River rises below Neglected Mountain and east of the settlement of Hillview. The river flows generally north, joined by six minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Logan River between Alberton and Eagleby. From there the Logan flows a further 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) before entering Moreton Bay.[3] The Albert River catchment is bounded by the McPherson Range to the south, the Beechmont Range in the east and the Jinbroken Range and Birnam Range to the west.[4] The river\u0027s upper catchment is heavily influenced by the national parks of Tamborine, Main Range and the Lamington Plateau, and numerous local government-owned reserves and conservation areas,[5] that comprise part of the Shield Volcano Group of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. Tributaries of the Albert River include the Stockyard Creek, Duck Creek, Kerry Creek, Cainbable Creek, Canungra Creek and Bidaddaba Creek.[1] The Albert River is crossed by the Pacific Motorway, the Old Pacific Highway, and the Gold Coast railway line at Yatala.[1] History [edit] Yugembah (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages in areas that include the Albert River, Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Beaudesert, Beenleigh, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama, Tamborine and Tweed River Valley, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley.[6] Mununjali (also known as Mananjahli, Manaldjahli and Manandjali) is a dialect of the Yugambeh language. The Mununjali language area includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Scenic Rim and Beaudesert Shire Councils.[7] The river was named by Robert Dixon[8] in honour of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.[9] A rise in the Albert River would see access to O\u0027Reilly\u0027s Rainforest Retreat difficult or impossible during its early years of operation.[10] Floods have been recorded on the Albert River in 1925, 1947, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1989, 2013 and 2017 (Cyclone Debbie).[11][12] In 1884, the S.S. Walrus ran aground on the bank of the river.[13] The vessel had been used as a floating sugar mill and distillery. Proposed dam [edit] In 1989, the Goss Government rejected a proposal to build Wolffdene Dam on the Albert River. Later, a dam near Glendower Homestead was once planned in a Queensland Government water strategy report from 1990. The option was discarded after it was revealed the site was too costly to build a dam for the amount of water it would have provided.[14] Environmental concerns [edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The water quality of the Albert River remains in relatively good condition until it merges with the Logan River where the quality declines. Residential and industry development and land clearing in the catchment have deteriorated the water quality of the Albert River, particularly in its lower reaches. Key environmental issues that face the catchment are rapid population increase and development; altered flow patterns of the creek causing active erosion; deteriorating water quality; increased noise and vehicle movements; waste dispo",

Shinto has no fixed doctrines or founder, but draws instead from creation myths described in books such as the Kojiki.[13]: 9  The December 15, 1945 \"Shinto Directive\" of the United States General Headquarters introduced the \"State Shinto\" distinction when it began governing Japan after the Second World War. The Shinto Directive (officially the \"Abolition of Governmental Sponsorship, Support, Perpetuation, Control and Dissemination of State Shinto\") defined State Shinto as \"that branch of Shinto (Kokka Shinto or Jinja Shinto) which, by official acts of the Japanese government, has been differentiated from the religion of Sect Shinto (Shuha Shinto or Kyoha Shinto) and has been classified a non-religious national cult.\"[5]: 41–42 [14] The \"State Shinto\" term was thus used to categorize and abolish Imperial Japanese practices that relied on Shinto to support nationalistic ideology.[6]: 133 [7]: 97  By declining to ban Shinto practices outright, Japan\u0027s post-war constitution was able to preserve full freedom of religion.[6]: 133  Definitions [edit] This 1878 engraving by Toyohara Chikanobu (1838–1912) visually presents the central tenet of State Shinto (1871–1946). This Shinto variant asserted and promoted belief in the divinity of the Emperor, which arose from a genealogical family tree extending back to the first emperor and to the most important deities of Japanese mythology.

He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a significant role in the Indian independence movement and India\u0027s political integration.[1] In Persian and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar meaning \"chief\". He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[2] Patel was born in Nadiad city (present-day Kheda district, Gujarat) and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.[3] He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi\u0027s earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress. Under the chairmanship of Patel \"Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy\" resolution was passed by the Congress. Patel\u0027s position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Bombay, he became the Congress\u0027s main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936.[4] While promoting the Quit India Movement, Patel made a climactic speech to more than 100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay on 7 August 1942. Historians believe that Patel\u0027s speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. Patel\u0027s organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India.[5] As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 \u0026 11 Geo. 6. c. 30). Patel, together with Jawaharlal Nehru and Louis Mountbatten persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India.[6] Patel\u0027s commitment to national integration in the newly independent country earned him the sobriquet \"Iron Man of India\".[7] He is also remembered as the \"patron saint of India\u0027s civil servants\" for playing a pioneering role in establishing the modern All India Services system. The Statue of Unity, the world\u0027s tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of US$420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.[8] Early life and background [edit] Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel,[9][10] one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat.[11] Patel\u0027s date of birth was never officially recorded; Patel entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers.[12] He belonged to the Patidars, specifically the Leva Patel community of Central Gujarat; although after his fame, both Leva Patel and Kadava Patidar have claimed him as one of their own.[13] Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts that he l",

Cito in multas linguas per orbem conversa est atque lectores adeo plurimos invenit ut auctor anno 1905 praemio Nobeliano honoratus sit. Plures pelliculae quoque ex argumento libri creatae sunt. Sienkiewicz qui ipse catholicus erat christianismum aetate Neroniana inter vitia paganorum nascentem describebat. De antiquitate scribere non solebat Sienkiewicz: pleraque eius opera (necnon eius actio civica) ad historiam patriae nationisque Polonicae spectabant quae tum inter Ruthenos et Germanos vi divisa civitate carebat. Ipse in parte Rutheniae adnexa vivebat. Itaque multi critici existimarunt sub nomine Neronis et primorum Christianorum censurae evadendae causa latere persecutiones Tzarum et Ecclesiae orthodoxae erga catholicos Polonos. Ad eandem interpretationem facit quod heroine barbara e gente Lygiorum orta dicitur quae partem meridionalem Poloniae antiquitus habitasse credebatur. Quae fortasse causa fuit cur Christianos ita ultra modum extulerit atque paganos—praeter Petronium—omnino denigrarit. Quod ut efficeret omnes accusationes rerum gestarum scriptorum antiquorum et postea Christianorum veras esse arbitratus etiam in maius vertit ita ut ad illud epicum genus dicendi pervenerit quod iudices Nobeliani in eo coronarunt. Praeterea magnas tabulas historicas pictore dignas narrationi inseruit: Bacchanalia in aula Neronis, apostolos in suburbanis coemeteriis praedicantes, magnum incendium Romae, supplicia Christianorum … ad mensium paginas priores inspiciendas vel novas proponendas Imago mensis Sciurus vulgaris in horto regali Lazienki, Varsovia Sciurus vulgaris in horto regali Lazienki, Varsovia ad mensium imagines priores inspiciendas vel novas proponendas Nuntii 2025 28 Novembris: Leo XIV papa in loco concilii Nicaeni Bartholomaeum patriarcham convenit et admonet, ut dissensiones superarentur.

Статия на седмицата Рибарско селище на остров Йоланд Йоланд е шведски остров, разположен в Балтийско море, близо до град Калмар. Със своите 1344 km2 това е и вторият по големина остров в Швеция (след Готланд). Населението на острова към 2013 година е 24 987 души, но по време на шведския празник Мидсомар на острова често се събират около 500 000 души. Остров Йоланд е естествено отделен от основната земя с протока Калмарсунд, но е достъпен посредством шесткилометровия мост Йоланд, изграден през 1972 година. Остров Йоланд е и най-малката историческа провинция на Швеция, която е част от бивше административно деление на Швеция. Съвременното административно деление включва остров Йоланд в рамките на лен Калмар. Островът има богата история, чието начало е поставено през 8 – 6 хилядолетие пр.н.е. с първите преселници. Редица археологически находки от каменната, желязната и викингската епоха, като фортификационни съоръжения, останки от селища и комплексни погребални церемонии, свидетелстват за живота на местното население и са ценен източник на информация за епохата. Историята на остров Йоланд продължава и през времената на Кралство Швеция, белязана от властта на шведските крале, а по-късно и от събитията около двете световни войни. Поминъкът на остров Йоланд е на основата на земеделие, риболов и търговия, като продължава да се базира на тези сектори и през 20 век. На острова съществуват няколко индустриални предприятия, но към 21 век повечето от тях са разрушени с изключение на няколко фабрики от леката промишленост. Туризмът е важно звено на приходи за острова, значително улеснен след построяването на моста над протока Калмарсунд. Островът се характеризира с дълга брегова ивица, редуваща абразивни, каменисти, песъчливи и тревисти плажове. Пясъчните плажове са сред най-дългите в Северна Европа. Водните ресурси на остров Йоланд са оскъдни, но въпреки това има малки езера, блата и реки.

The logo on the computer screen is a Creative Commons license, while the paper explains, in Khmer, that the image is open content. Free content, libre content, libre information, or free information is any kind of creative work,[1] such as a work of art, a book,[2] a software program,[3][4] or any other creative content for which there are very minimal copyright and other legal limitations on usage, modification and distribution. These are works or expressions which can be freely studied, applied, copied and modified by anyone for any purpose[5][6] including, in some cases, commercial purposes. Free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the definition of free cultural work.[7] In most countries, the Berne Convention grants copyright holders control over their creations by default.[8] Therefore, copyrighted content must be explicitly declared free by the authors, which is usually accomplished by referencing or including licensing statements from within the work.[9] The right to reuse such a work is granted by the authors in a license known as a free license, a free distribution license, or an open license, depending on the rights assigned.[9] These freedoms given to users in the reuse of works (that is, the right to freely use, study, modify or distribute these works, possibly also for commercial purposes) are often associated with obligations (to cite the original author, to maintain the original license of the reused content) or restrictions (excluding commercial use, banning certain media) chosen by the author.[10] There are a number of standardized licenses offering varied options that allow authors to choose the type of reuse of their work that they wish to authorize or forbid.[11] Definition There are a number of different definitions of free content in regular use. Legally, however, free content is very similar to open content. An analogy is a use of the rival terms free software and open-source, which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.[12][13] The term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement.[14][15] For instance, the Open Knowledge Foundation\u0027s Open Definition describes \"open\" as synonymous with the definition of free in the \"Definition of Free Cultural Works\" (as also in the Open Source Definition and Free Software Definition).[16] For such free/open content both movements recommend the same three Creative Commons licenses, the CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0.[17][18][19][20] Legal background Copyright Main article: Copyright Copyright symbol Copyright is a legal concept, which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the duplication and public performance of their work.[21] In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the public domain.[22] Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works.[21] During the time period of copyright the author\u0027s work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a fair use.[23] Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the author\u0027s content or limit their use to fair use. Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.[24] Finally, it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as mashups and collaborative content.[25] Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to copyright, open content licenses rely on a copyright holder\u0027s power to license their work, as copyleft which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.[26] Public domain Main article: Public domain Public domain symbol The public domain is a range of creative works whose copyright has expired or was never established, as well as ideas and facts[note 1] which are ineligible for copyright. A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such, any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise use the work, without legal ramifications. A work in the public domain or released under a permissive license may be referred to as \"copycenter\".[27] Copyleft Main article: Copyleft Copyleft symbol Copyleft is a play on the word copyright and describes the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work.[28] The aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable non-author parties to be able to reuse and, in many licensing schemes, modify content that is created by an auth",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This article is about the chart compiled by New Musical Express. For other singles charts compiled in the 1950s, see List of UK charts and number-one singles (1952–1969).

Record charts in the UK began life in 1952 when Percy Dickins from New Musical Express (NME) imitated an idea started in American Billboard magazine and began compiling a hit parade. Prior to this, a song\u0027s popularity was measured by the sales of sheet music.[1][2] Initially, Dickins telephoned a sample of around 20 shops asking for a list of the 10 best-selling songs. These results were then aggregated to give a Top 12 chart published in NME on 14 November 1952.[1][2] The number-one single was \"Here in My Heart\" by Al Martino. According to The Official Charts Company and Guinness\u0027 British Hit Singles \u0026 Albums, the NME is considered the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960.[3] However, until 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, there was no universally accepted chart. Other charts existed and different artists may have placed at number one in charts by Record Mirror, Disc or Melody Maker. Alternatively, some considered the BBC\u0027s Pick of the Pops, which averaged all these charts, to be a better indicator of the number-one single.[2] In terms of number-one singles, Frankie Laine, Guy Mitchell and Elvis Presley were the most successful artists of the 1950s, having four singles reach the top spot.[nb 1] The longest duration of a single at number one was eighteen weeks, achieved by Frankie Laine\u0027s \"I Believe\". \"I Believe\" still holds the record for the most non-consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart.[5] It is believed that the three best-selling records of the decade – Bill Haley \u0026 His Comets\u0027 \"Rock Around the Clock\", Paul Anka\u0027s \"Diana\" and Harry Belafonte\u0027s \"Mary\u0027s Boy Child\" – all sold over one million copies.[6][7][8] Number-one singles [edit] Elvis Presley in a publicity photo for \"Jailhouse Rock\" which was the best-selling single of 1958. Presley had three other number ones in the 1950s. Al Martino\u0027s \"Here in My Heart\" was the first ever number-one single and held the top spot for nine weeks. Bill Haley \u0026 His Comets had the biggest-selling single of the decade with \"Rock Around the Clock\". Doris Day had two number-one singles in the 1950s, one of which, \"Secret Love\", was the best-selling record of 1954.

Benvida COMOs Preguntas frecuentes Comunidade Políticas Artigos de calidade Axuda Artigo destacado Minecraft é un videoxogo de mundo aberto tipo sandbox creado orixinalmente polo deseñador e programador sueco Markus \"Notch\" Persson e desenvolvido e publicado posteriormente pola empresa fundada por el, Mojang. Os aspectos creativos e de construción de Minecraft permítenlles ós xogadores construír elementos a partir de cubos con diversas texturas nun mundo en tres dimensións xerado por procedementos. Outras actividades do xogo inclúen a exploración, a recolección de recursos, a confección de obxectos e o combate. Dispón de varios modos de xogo, incluíndo un modo de supervivencia no que o xogador debe conseguir recursos para construír o mundo de xogo e manter a súa saúde, un modo creativo no que os recursos son ilimitados e o xogador ten a capacidade de voar, un modo de aventuras que permite xogar niveis e mapas creados por outros xogadores e un modo espectador no que os xogadores poden voar e observar o mundo pero sen interactuar con el. A versión para PC do xogo destaca pola súa comunidade de modding. Outros artigos destacados • Artigos de calidade Sobre Galicia Ricardo Courtier, nado na Coruña o 10 de marzo de 1865 e finado en Ourense o 10 de decembro de 1922, foi un músico e compositor galego. Nado nunha familia de músicos, é considerado o membro máis salientable da terceira xeración de músicos da saga Courtier. Logo de finalizar a súa formación instalouse na Pobra de Trives, onde foi director da banda de música. Foi precisamente nesta vila ourensá onde desenvolveu un intenso labor fundando diversas agrupacións e compoñendo obras que serían interpretadas por estas. Posteriormente trasladouse coa súa familia á cidade de Ourense, onde residiu ata o seu falecemento, e onde foi director da Banda de Música Municipal. A súa obra salienta pola influencia da música tradicional galega, con harmonías sinxelas e formas típicas da música popular. Ademais do seu labor como compositor, Ricardo Courtier realizou arranxos para as distintas agrupacións que liderou.

տեսախաղերի, պոռնոգրաֆիայի և ծրագրային ապահովման անվճար որոնվող առցանց ինդեքս: 2003 թվականին հիմնադրել է շվեդական Piratbyran վերլուծական կենտրոնը: The Pirate Bay-ը հեշտացնում է peer-to-peer torrent արձանագրության օգտատերերի միջև կապը, որոնք կարող են ներդրում ունենալ կայքում մագնիսական հղումների ավելացման միջոցով։ The Pirate Bay-ը մշտապես դասվել է աշխարհի ամենաշատ այցելվող torrent կայքերից մեկի շարքին: Տարիների ընթացքում կայքը մի քանի անգամ ենթարկվել է սերվերների ռեյդերի, անջատումների և դոմենների առգրավումների և շարունակել է իր գործունեությունը մի շարք նոր վեբ հասցեների միջոցով: Մի շարք երկրներում ինտերնետային ծառայություններ մատուցողներին (ISP) հրահանգվել է արգելափակել դրա մուտքը։ Հետագայում ի հայտ են եկել պրոքսի կայքեր՝ արգելափակումները շրջանցելու համար: 2009 թվականի ապրիլին կայքի

տարվա ազատազրկման և տուգանքի։ Նրանք բոլորը ազատ են արձակվել մինչև 2015 թվականը՝ կրճատված պատիժ կրելուց հետո։ «Ծովահենների ծոցը» (Pirate Bay) վեճերի և քննարկումների առիթ է դարձել ֆայլերի փոխանակման, հեղինակային իրավունքի և քաղաքացիական ազատությունների իրավական ասպեկտների վերաբերյալ և դարձել է մտավոր սեփականության վերաբերյալ հաստատված օրենքների դեմ քաղաքական նախաձեռնությունների հարթակ, ինչպես նաև

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Local government area\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (October 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A local government area (LGA) is an administrative division of a country that a local government is responsible for. The size of an LGA varies by country but it is generally a subdivision of a state, province, division, or territory. The phrase is used as a generalised description in the United Kingdom to refer to a variety of political divisions such as boroughs, counties, unitary authorities, and cities, all of which have a council or similar body exercising a degree of self-government. Each of the United Kingdom\u0027s four constituent countries has its own structure of local government, for example Northern Ireland has local districts; many parts of England have non-metropolitan counties consisting of rural districts; London and many other urban areas have boroughs; there are three islands councils off the coast of Scotland; while the rest of Scotland and all of Wales are divided into unitary authority counties, some of which are officially designated as cities. As such the term local government area is a convenient generic label referring to all of these authorities and the areas within their control. Map of Australian local government areas The term is particularly common in Australia where it is synonymous with \"municipality\".[citation needed] Local government authorities across the country have similar functions and powers,[citation needed] but have different official designations in different states, and according to whether they are urban or rural. Most urban municipalities in all states are \"cities\".[1] Many in Western Australia are officially \"towns\", even within the Perth metropolitan area.[1] Many rural areas in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia are \"shires\", while rural areas in South Australia have \"district councils\", and those in Tasmania officially use the title \"municipality\".[1] Due to the Australian Capital Territory\u0027s small size it has no local government and is instead overseen by the ACT Legislative Assembly.[1] Australian LGA status by state/territory[1] State/territory LGA status New South Wales Cities Areas Northern Territory Cities Towns Municipalities Shires Queensland Cities Shires Towns Regional councils South Australia Cities Rural cities Municipalities/municipal councils District councils Regional councils Towns Aboriginal councils Tasmania Cities Municipalities Victoria Cities Rural cities Boroughs Shires Western Australia Cities Towns Shires It is largely for this reason that the term \"local government area\", or simply \"LGA\", is favoured over the term \"municipality\", the use of which could easily lead to confusion. In recent years changes to the structures of local government have given rise to new official designations, while other terms have fallen out of favour. In the mid-1990s the state government of Victoria amalgamated almost all municipalities, abolishing many cities and shires, all towns and all but one borough. Queenscliff, south of Melbourne, is now the only place in Australia that is officially a borough. Meanwhile, many \"rural cities\" were formed in largely rural areas where the core town is large enough, in terms of population, to be considered a city. In many such cases that town had previously been governed by a now defunct city council. Restructuring of local government in New South Wales and Queensland in the following decade gave rise to the municipal designations of \"region\" and \"area\", for example, the Sunshine Coast of Queensland was formerly divided into several shires, but is now governed by a single Sunshine Coast Regional Council. \"Local government area\" is also an official designation in The Gambia and Nigeria.

Избрана статија Пристаништето на Ница Ница — петти најнаселен град во Франција, по Париз, Марсеј, Лион и Тулуза. Урбаната област на Ница се протега надвор од административните граници на градот со население од околу еден милион и зафаќа површина од 721 км². Сместен на југоисточниот брег на Франција на Средоземното Море, Ница е вториот најголем француски град на средоземниот брег, веднаш зад Марсеј. Градот е наречен Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella на окситански), што означува Убавата Ница, што исто така е името на неофицијалната химна на Ница, напишана од Меника Рондели во 1912. Ница е главен град на департманот Приморски Алпи и втор најголем град во регионот Прованса-Алпи-Азурен Брег по Марсеј. Површината на денешна Ница се протега на „Тера Амата“, археолошко наоѓалиште во кое се најдени докази за многу рано користење на оганот. Околу 350 п.н.е., Грците од Марсеј основале постојана населба и ја нарекле Никаја, по божицата на победата Ника. Низ вековите, градот бил заземан многу пати од разни освојувачи. Неговата стратешка местоположба и пристаништето значајно придонеле за неговата поморска сила. Низ вековите бил владение на Савоја, потоа станал дел од Франција помеѓу 1792 и 1815, кога бил вратен на Пиемонт-Сардинија до неговото повторно припојување кон Франција во 1860. Природната убавина на Ница и нејзината умерена средоземна клима им го привлекло вниманието на богатите Англичани во втората половина на XVIII век, кога голем број на благороднички семејства ги поминувале нивните зими овде. Главното градско шеталиште крај морето, Англиската променада (Promenade des Anglais) го добило своето име во име на посетителите на градот. (Дознајте повеќе...) архива • критериуми На денешен ден...

Гэты фільм з’яўляецца першай карцінай кінарэжысёра, якую ён часткова здымаў за межамі Польшчы. Фільм расказвае гісторыю дзвюх маладых жанчын: польскай харысткі Веранікі і, як дзве кроплі вады падобнай на яе, французскай настаўніцы музыкі Веранік.

Вай беш аз 450 рисолаи илмӣ навиштааст, ки то замони мо танҳо 240-то аз он маҳфуз мондаанд. Ин рисолаҳо тамоми соҳаҳои илмро фароҳам гирифта, хусусан, 150-тояшон дар илми фалсафа ва беш аз 40-тои дигар дар илми пизишкӣ ҳастанд.

Дар ҷавонӣ барои таҳсил ба Бағдод рафт ва назди Матто ибни Юнус ба фаро гирифтани мантиқ ва фалсафа пардохт. Сипас ба Ҳаррони Сурия сафар кард ва ба шогирдии Юҳанно ибни Ҳилон даромад. Аз оғози кор, ҳуши саршор ва илмомӯзии вай сабаб шуд, ки ҳамаи мавзӯъҳоеро, ки тадрис мешуд, ба хубӣ фаро бигирад. Ба зудӣ номи ӯ ба унвони файласуф ва донишманд шӯҳрат ёфт. Ва чун ба Бағдод бозгашт, гурӯҳе аз шогирдон гирди ӯ ҷамъ омаданд, ки Яҳё ибни Адий, файласуфи масеҳӣ яке аз онон буд. Дар соли 330 ҳиҷрии қамарӣ (941 милодӣ) ба Димишқ рафт ва ба Сайфуддавлаи Ҳамадонӣ, ҳокими Ҳалаб пайваст ва дар зумраи уламои дарбори ӯ даромад. Форобӣ аз рӯи маълумоти Ибни Халлиқон дар соли 950 - 951 дар Димишқ дар синни 80-солагӣ дунёро падруд ва дар қабристони «Бобу-с-сағир» дар даврони салтанати Сайфуддавла бо шукӯҳу қадрдонӣ ба хок супорида шудааст.

The cabinet continues to fulfill its duties as caretaker government until the appointment of the next government. The cabinet was initially elected with the support of APS. However, on 16 April 2025, following disagreements with the government and the passing of legislation with DPS–NN, the party announced it would no longer support the government.[5] The government\u0027s primary commitment has been the country\u0027s entry into the eurozone in 2026.[6][7][8] Though the government is not committed to creating a formal deal, it has been widely reported on and accepted that the government\u0027s majority depends on the support of DPS–NN.[9][10][11][12] Prior to the approval of Bulgaria\u0027s accession to the Eurozone in July 2025, PP–DB, the largest parliamentary opposition, had pledged to abstain in no-confidence votes.[13][14][15] Cabinet [edit] Cabinet members Portfolio Minister Took office Left office Party Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Deputy Prime Minister without portfolio Atanas Zafirov 16 January 2025 Incumbent BSP Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Innovation and Growth Tomislav Donchev 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport and Communications Grozdan Karadzhov 16 January 2025 Incumbent ITN Minister of Finance Temenuzhka Petkova 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Minister of Defence Atanas Zapryanov[b] 16 January 2025 (reappointed) Incumbent Independent Minister of Foreign Affairs Georg Georgiev 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Minister of Interior Daniel Mitov 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Minister of Justice Georgi Georgiev 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Minister of Health Silvi Kirilov 16 January 2025 Incumbent ITN Minister of Education and Science Krasimir Valchev 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Minister of Agriculture and Foods Georgi Tahov[b] 16 January 2025 (reappointed) Incumbent Independent Minister of Environment and Waters Manol Genov 16 January 2025 Incumbent BSP Minister of Energy Zhecho Stankov 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Minister of Tourism Miroslav Borshosh 16 January 2025 Incumbent GERB Minister of Economy and Industry Petar Dilov 16 January 2025 Incumbent ITN Minister of Regional Development and Public Works Ivan Ivanov 16 January 2025 Incumbent BSP Minister of Culture Marian Bachev 16 January 2025 Incumbent ITN Minister of Youth and Sports Ivan Peshev 16 January 2025 Incumbent BSP Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Borislav Gutsanov 16 January 2025 Incumbent BSP Minister of Electronic Governance Valentin Mundrov[b] 16 January 2025 (reappointed) Incumbent Independent Votes of no confidence [edit] Proposer Sector Date of submission Date of vote Yes No Abstentions Absentees Outcome Revival, MECh and Velichie foreign policy[16] 26 March 2025 3 April 2025 54 Revival (33) MECh (11) Velichie (10) 150 GERB-SDS (66) DPS-NN (29) DPS-DPS (19) BSP-OL (19) ITN (17) 0 36 PP-DB (36) unsuccessful fight against corruption[17] 10 April 2025 17 April 2025 72 Revival (33) DPS-DPS (19) MECh (11) Velichie (9) 130 GERB-SDS (66) DPS-NN (28) BSP-OL (19) ITN (17) 0 38 PP-DB (36) DPS-NN (1) Velichie (1) unsuccessful fiscal policy[18] 27 June 2025 4 July 2025 54 Revival (33) MECh (11) Velichie (10) 130 GERB-SDS (65) DPS-NN (27) BSP-OL (17) ITN (17) Independent (4) 0 56 GERB-SDS (1) PP-DB (36) DPS-NN (2) BSP-OL (2) APS (15) Velichie (1) unsuccessful environment and water[19] 3 July 2025 11 July 2025 83 Revival (32) PP-DB (17) APS (14) MECh (10) Velichie (10) 131 GERB-SDS (64) DPS-NN (29) BSP-OL (19) ITN (15) Independent (4) 0 26 GERB-SDS (2) PP-DB (19) Revival (1) ITN (2) APS (1) MECh (1) unsuccessful PP-DB, APS and MECh internal security and justice[20] 12 September 2025 18 September 2025 101 PP-DB (35) Revival (33) APS (12) MECh (11) ",

Nevyrábali sa len nádoby, ako sú džbány a nádoby na pitie a jedlo, ale i také predmety, ako veľké kade, pece, sarkofágy, kanvice, vedrá, panvice, mažiare na drvenie, kozmetické skrinky, hračky, sochy, sošky, architektonické ozdoby, lampy a dekoratívne predmety (či nádoby). Keramické výrobky sa používali tiež pri obchodovaní, v remeslách a verejnom živote, napríklad ako hlasovacie urny, vodné hodiny, odmerky na tekutiny či sypké látky. Keramické nádoby, napr. čiernofigúrové panathenajské amfory sa dávali ako ceny pre víťazov na hrách. O nevšednom keramickom tovare s umeleckým zdobením sa toho vie viac, lebo sa často zachoval v hrobkách relatívne nepoškodený. Menej vedomostí je o obyčajných každodenných predmetoch, napríklad používaných v kuchyni, aj keď boli vo všetkých obdobiach zrejme bežnejšie. Vo vývinovej línii (chronologicky) sa výzdoba starogréckej keramiky rozlišuje na geometrickú, orientalizujúcu, čiernofigúrovú, červenofigúrovú, na bielom podklade a neskorú. Grécke keramické nádoby svojou štýlovou rozmanitosťou a rozšírením po celom gréckom svete (a jeho okolí) spôsobili bádateľom nemálo starostí. Tvar (typ) nádoby sa ale niekedy dal určiť pomerne jednoducho, občas bol nejaký antický termín použitý na základe dohody. Avšak o známych názvoch niektorých tvarov nádob, väčšinou tu ide atickú okrasnú keramiku, sa už dnes vie, že sú nesprávne (niekedy sa totiž vyrábali aj novinky typov váz, podľa požiadavok užívateľa). Rovnaký tvar mohla mať i celkom prostá nádoba i nádoba krásne zdobená. Najbežnejším zdobeným typom nádob boli poháre. Niektoré tvary nádob sa vyrábali aj z iných materiálov, napríklad z kameňa či kovu. celý článok...

Selected Very Good Article Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 – February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. He was the creator, producer, head writer, and host of the children\u0027s television series Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighborhood from 1968 until he retired in 2001. He was also the music composer for the program. Rogers was not happy with the television shows that children were seeing. He began to write and perform local Pittsburgh-area shows for children. In 1968, Eastern Educational Television Network began distributing Rogers\u0027s new show across the United States on WQED. For thirty years, Rogers became a television icon of children\u0027s entertainment and education. Rogers supported many public causes. In the Betamax case, the U.S. Supreme Court used what Rogers said before a lower court to support fair use television recording. Rogers also spoke before a U.S. Senate committee to support government money for children\u0027s television. In August 2001, Rogers retired from recording Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighborhood. In October 2002, doctors told him he had stomach cancer. He died from the disease a few months later on February 27, 2003. He was 74 years old. more...

A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, while the head of a glassblowing workshop is known as a gaffer. The process was invented by Syrian craftsmen from Hama and Aleppo between 27 BC and 14 AD, who discovered the previously unknown property of glass that a molten blob can be inflated by introducing a small amount of air into it. It was then adopted across the Roman Empire and has been in use since then. Glassblowing utilises the liquid structure of glass, the atoms being held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network, which means that molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually harden as it loses heat. This photograph shows a man working on a glass project after removing it from a kiln at Brooklyn Glass in New York City, United States.Photograph credit: Rhododendrites Archive – More featured pictures...

Closely related to the llama, the guanaco is native to the steppes, scrublands and mountainous regions of South America, including Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Argentina. It is a diurnal animal, living in small herds consisting of either one male and several females with their young, or separate bachelor herds. It can run at speeds of up to 64 km/h (40 mph), important for avoiding predation. A herbivore, the guanaco grazes on grasses, shrubs, herbs, lichens, fungi, cacti, and flowers, while its natural predators include the puma and the culpeo (Andean fox). Some guanacos are found domesticated in zoos and private herds around the world, and its fiber is also harvested for use in luxury fabrics, being noted for its soft, warm feel. This guanaco was photographed in Torres del Paine, Chile.Photograph credit: Charles J. Sharp Archive – More featured pictures...
