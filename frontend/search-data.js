    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Minecraft urban legend Fictional character Herobrine An in-game render of Herobrine Based on Steve Herobrine is an urban legend and creepypasta from the sandbox video game Minecraft. He is often depicted as a version of the Minecraft character Steve, but with solid white eyes that lack pupils, and behavior that primarily involves destroying the player\u0027s world. The story originated from an anonymous post on 4chan\u0027s /v/ board in 2010, where the author reported encountering a strange figure in a single-player world, followed by their messages being deleted when they attempted to talk to other players about the sighting. The story was further popularized after livestreamers Copeland and Patimuss created their own versions. Herobrine has become a popular part of the online culture surrounding Minecraft, as well as effectively an internet meme. Interest in the character inspired many to create their own stories and alleged sightings centered around Herobrine, as well as create Minecraft mods that add him to the game. Interest in the character continued into the 2020s, leading to the rediscovery of formerly lost media related to the original sightings. Herobrine has been considered one of the most notable legends in video games, with his popularity leading to him ranking on a Guinness World Records poll for the best video game villains despite never truly existing within Minecraft. The character has been referenced several times by the developers of Minecraft, appearing on official artwork as well. Origins and characteristics The screenshot provided in the original Herobrine sighting, posted to 4chan in 2010.[1] Herobrine can be spotted in the fog to the left of the hill. In 2010, during Minecraft\u0027s alpha stage of development, an anonymous post was made on 4chan\u0027s /v/ board, where the author claimed to encounter a mysterious entity while playing the game. The post claimed that shortly after starting a new world, the author saw what they believed to be a cow in the distance, which they approached in order to kill it. Upon approaching it, they instead saw a second player character with solid white eyes staring at them from the fog before vanishing. After the encounter, the author noticed numerous strange structures that they did not create. They claimed that when trying to contact other players about the event, they found their posts removed, eventually receiving a message from a user named \"Herobrine\" that simply said \"stop.\" The anonymous post went on to claim that other players informed him that Herobrine was the alias of the brother of Notch, the creator of Minecraft. The 4chan post claimed that Notch said, in response to queries about whether he had a brother, \"I did, but he is no longer with us.\"[1] Around the same time, another anonymous post on 4chan wrote about another entity the author seemingly encountered in a cave after listening to the in-game music disc \"13\", which also had white eyes that lurked in the fog. This encounter was simply named \"White Eyes\", and was believed to be related to Herobrine.[2] Shortly after the original stories were published, livestreamers Copeland and Patimuss, the former of which saw and liked the original posts, staged Herobrine encounters of their own. In Copeland\u0027s stream, he played in a survival world with a custom texture pack for around two hours while working on a house. After entering a room he was planning on furnishing, he saw Herobrine staring at him and he quickly left the house and exited the game, before ending the livestream. This encounter was created by Copeland modifying in-game textures to make Herobrine appear. Afterwards, viewers of the livestream were redirected to a GIF depicting Herobrine with moving, realistic eyes. In Patimuss\u0027 stream, he encountered Herobrine walking on lava while playing the game, before promptly shutting the game down.[1][3] After Copeland\u0027s stream, he claimed that his computer crashed when trying to go live again afterwards. He then shared a webpage with the title \"him.html\". The page featured a gif of Steve, the default skin of Minecraft, with his pixelated eyes replaced with realistic, moving ones, as well as text at the bottom that wrote about how the reader was \"living in a fantasy world inside their mind\" and needed to \"wake up.\" This granted Herobrine the additional nickname \"HIM.\"[1] After these streams, the popularity of Herobrine spread across the Minecraft community, with people creating their own alleged sightings, as well as developing Minecraft mods to add the character to the game themselves. Most claimed sightings of Herobrine are accompanied by red text annotations and eerie music.[3] In stories and mods centered around Herobrine, he is typically summoned through the creation of a structure made up of gold and other in-game materials.[3] His most common traits include constructing abnormal structures and causing destruction, such as by digging random tunnels t",

Over time, the movement\u0027s focus shifted toward male separatism.[5] Far-right commentator and polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos is credited with helping to popularize MGTOW with a 2014 Breitbart article titled \"The Sexodus\", in which he described men who were eschewing women, love, sex, and marriage because of feminism.[12] MGTOW discussion forums include the subreddit r/MGTOW, created in 2011, smaller auxiliary subreddits, and MGTOW Forum, an independent website that emerged in 2014. Following Reddit\u0027s 2017 ban of a large incel subreddit, r/MGTOW was briefly the largest and most active manosphere forum on the site.[13] Researchers have implicated MGTOW communities in online harassment of women. r/MGTOW and MGTOW Forum are among the communities which \"have been growing in size and in their involvement in online harassment and real-world violence\", according to computer scientist Manoel Horta Ribeiro and colleagues.[14] Communications researcher Scott Wright and colleagues state that \"MGTOW propagate extensive and wide-ranging passive or undirected harassment and misogyny on Twitter.\"[15] Shortly after publication of a 2020 preprint of a paper examining manosphere groups online, Reddit quarantined r/MGTOW, a restriction the platform applies to subreddits determined to be \"extremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor\" which prevents them from earning advertising revenue and requires visitors to agree to seeing potentially offensive content before entering.[16] r/MGTOW was banned in August 2021 for breaking the site\u0027s policies against promotion of violence and hate.[17] Membership Members of MGTOW communities are primarily heterosexual, white, middle-class men from North America and Europe. Unlike the men\u0027s rights movement, MGTOW do not permit women to join.[18] MGTOW often disavow hierarchies and claim to be leaderless; some deny that MGTOW is a group or movement at all, instead emphasizing each member\u0027s individuality and independence within a collective.[19] Researcher Callum Jones and colleagues write in New Media \u0026 Society that \"while the precise number of MGTOW followers is unclear, it appears to be a popular and growing group within the Manosphere\".[20] As of 2018[update], MGTOW was smaller than both the men\u0027s rights movement and the pickup artist communities online, with MGTOW Forum having over 25,000 subscribers and the subreddit r/MGTOW having over 35,000.[21] The subreddit had grown to 104,000 members by 2019,[note 1] with another MGTOW forum listing over 32,000 members.[20] Ideology MGTOW advocate for men to withdraw from what they see as a gynocentric society that has been corrupted by feminism.[22] MGTOW believe that men are better off avoiding any relationships with women, including marriage. Instead, the group believes that men should either abstain from sex with women entirely, or alternatively only have casual sex while avoiding romantic or financial commitments.[3] Online MGTOW rhetoric is characterized by anti-feminism, masculism,[23] and misogyny.[24] MGTOW believe that feminism has made women dangerous to men, and that male self-preservation requires dissociating completely from women.[25] A 2020 study by Wright et al. found that despite MGTOW claiming to reject women entirely, some 59% of MGTOW forum posts mentioned women, with the majority (61%) of those mentions being misogynistic in some way.[3] Jones et al. suggest that this reflects a need for MGTOW to perform their rejection of women in order to belong.[26] The MGTOW c",

The Harem Ağası, head of the black eunuchs of the Ottoman Imperial Harem A eunuch (/ˈjuː.nək/ ⓘ YOO-nək, Ancient Greek: εὐνοῦχος) is a boy or man who has been castrated.[1] Throughout history, castration often served a specific social function.[2] The earliest records for intentional castration to produce eunuchs are from the Sumerian city of Lagash in the 2nd millennium BC.[3][4] Over the millennia since, they performed a wide variety of functions in many different cultures: courtiers or equivalent domestics, for espionage or clandestine operations, castrato singers, concubines or sexual partners, religious specialists, soldiers, royal guards, government officials, and guardians of women or harem servants.[5] Eunuchs were usually servants or slaves who were castrated to make them less threatening servants of a royal court where physical access to the ruler could wield great influence.[6] Seemingly lowly domestic functions—such as making the ruler\u0027s bed, bathing him, cutting his hair, carrying him in his litter, or even relaying messages—could, in theory, give a eunuch \"the ruler\u0027s ear\" and impart de facto power to the formally humble but trusted servant. Eunuchs supposedly did not generally have loyalties to the military, the aristocracy, or a family of their own (having neither offspring nor in-laws, at the very least). They were thus seen as more trustworthy and less interested in establishing a private dynasty. Because their condition usually lowered their social status, they could also be easily replaced or killed without repercussion. Eunuchs have been documented in several ancient and medieval societies, including the Byzantine Empire, Imperial China, the Ottoman Empire, and various Middle Eastern cultures. They often held significant power and influence in these societies, particularly in royal courts and harems.[7] Etymology [edit] Eunuch comes from the Ancient Greek word εὐνοῦχος[8] (eunoûkhos), first attested in a fragment of Hipponax,[9] the 6th century BCE comic poet and prolific inventor of compound words.[10] The acerbic poet describes a particular lover of fine food having \"consumed his estate dining lavishly and at leisure every day on tuna and garlic-honey cheese paté like a Lampsacene eunoukhos.\"[11] The earliest surviving etymology of the word is from late antiquity. The 5th century (CE) Etymologicon by Orion of Thebes offers two alternative origins for the word eunuch: first, to tēn eunēn ekhein, \"guarding the bed\", a derivation inferred from eunuchs\u0027 established role at the time as \"bedchamber attendants\" in the imperial palace, and second, to eu tou nou ekhein, \"being good with respect to the mind\", which Orion explains based on their \"being deprived of intercourse (esterēmenou tou misgesthai), the things that the ancients used to call irrational (anoēta, literally: \u0027mindless\u0027)\".[12] Orion\u0027s second option reflects well-established idioms in Ancient Greek, as shown by entries for transl. grc – transl. noos, eunoos and ekhein in Liddell and Scott\u0027s Greek-English Lexicon, while the first option is not listed as an idiom under eunē in that standard reference work.[13] However, the first option was cited by the late 9th century Byzantine emperor Leo VI in his New Constitution 98 banning the marriage of eunuchs, in which he noted eunuchs\u0027 reputation as trustworthy guardians of the marriage bed (eunē) and claimed that the very word eunuch attested to this kind of employment.[14] The emperor also goes further than Orion by attributing eunuchs\u0027 lack of male–female intercourse specifically to castration, which he said was performed with the intention \"that they will no longer do the things that males do, or at least to extinguish whatever has to do with desire for the female sex\".[15] The 11th century Byzantine monk Nikon of the Black Mountain, opting instead for Orion\u0027s second alternative, stated that the word came from eunoein (eu \"good\" + nous \"mind\"), thus meaning \"to be well-minded, well-inclined, well-disposed or favorable\", but unlike Orion he argued that this was due to the trust that certain jealous and suspicious foreign rulers placed in the loyalty of their eunuchized servants.[16] Theophylact of Ohrid in a dialogue In Defence of Eunuchs also stated that the origin of the word was from eupnoeic and ekhein, \"to have, hold\", since they were always \"well-disposed\" toward the master who \"held\" or owned them.[17][18] The 12th century Etymologicum Magnum (s.v. eunoukhos) essentially repeats the entry from Orion, but stands by the first option, while attributing the second option to what \"some say\". In the late 12th century, Eustathius of Thessalonica (Commentaries on Homer 1256.30, 1643.16) offered an original derivation of the word from eunis + okheuein, \"deprived of mating\".[citation needed] In translations of the Bible into modern European languages, such as the Luther",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Ancient Scythian religious figure Not to be confused with Inari. The Enarei, singular Enaree, were Scythian priestesses and shamanistic soothsayers who played an important role in the Scythian religion. They served the Snake-Legged Goddess and the goddess Artimpasa. Name [edit] The English name Enaree is derived from the Ancient Greek name recorded by Herodotus of Halicarnassus as Enarees (Ἐνάρεες),[1][2] itself derived from the Scythian term Anarya, meaning \"unmanly.\"[3] The term anarya is composed of the elements a-, meaning \"non-,\" and narya, which was derived from nar-, meaning \"man.\"[4] The name Anarya was more accurately represented in Ancient Greek by Pseudo-Hippocrates as Anarieis (Ἀναριεῖς).[3][5] The Enarei were Scythian, yet most of these names were recorded by Greek writers and thus may not reflect the names that the Enarei or their society used to describe themselves. Importantly, many of these Greek writers disapproved of the Enarei and blamed them for sacking the temple of Aphrodite Ourania at Ascalon, describing their origins negatively. Their original names have not been recorded.[6][7] Religious role [edit] The Enarei were affiliated with an orgiastic cult of two closely related goddesses: Artimpasa and the Scythians\u0027 ancestral Snake-Legged Goddess. The forms of the goddesses the Enarei served were strongly influenced by Near Eastern fertility goddesses. Thus the rites of the Enarei combined indigenous Scythian religious practices of a shamanistic nature, which were themselves related to those of indigenous Siberian peoples, as well as ones imported from Levantine religions.[6][7][8] Rituals [edit] Some modern scholars believe the Enarei served largely similar purposes in the cult of Artimpasa as priests of other genders. There is limited written evidence, but a wider body of archaeological evidence, that depicts the Enarei\u0027s roles in rituals and the more general role of the cult.[6] One ornamental panel from the 3rd or 4th century B.C. shows an Enarei priest serving wine for a holy communion alongside the chief priestess of the goddess.[6] The Enarei likely also led Scythian funeral rituals. After the mummification and burial of the deceased, involved priests ritually cleansed themselves with the vapour of cannabis, in a shamanic ritual. Herodotus described this as a tent-based cleansing that would cause the priests to howl with laughter. Funerary practices are also attested archaeologically in Saka tombs from Siberia, which contained tripods, braziers, pelts, and charcoal containing remains of cannabis leaves and fruits. A pot from one of the Pazyryk burials contained cannabis fruits, as well as a copper censer used to burn cannabis. Although this documentary and archaeological evidence does not explicitly link Enarei to these rituals, it confirms the involvement of at least some priests in the cult of Artimpasa.[6] Cannabis was likely used for both communal and funerary or psychopompic rituals, making these priests among the earliest spiritual practitioners to have used cannabis to achieve altered states of consciousness.[6] Divination [edit] The Enarei also acted as seers, performing a unique role in the cult. They practiced a particular form of divination which used the inner bark of the linden tree, unlike the methods of traditional Scythian soothsayers which used willow withies.[8] The Enarei divined by cutting the inner linden bark into three pieces, and plaiting and unplaiting these pieces around their fingers to obtain answers.[9][6] For Scythians in Russia, linden then became a symbol for the third gender, or for people who are feminine-presenting and born male.[6] The Enarei were especially consulted when the king of the Scythians was ill,[10][6] which was itself believed by the Scythians to be caused by a false oath being sworn upon the king\u0027s hearth.[8] Once the Enarei had identified the suspect who had sworn the false oath, the said suspect would claim to be innocent. If the Enarei maintained the accusation, six more soothsayers were consulted, and if they upheld the original accusation, the suspect was executed by being beheaded. If the additional soothsayers declared the suspect was innocent, the process of consulting more soothsayers was repeated.[11] If the soothsayers all found the accused to be guilty, the culprit was executed through beheading, and his property was divided among the Enarei who had found him guilty.[12] However, if the larger number of soothsayers still declared the suspect to be innocent, the initial accusers were executed. The accusing soothsayers were put into an oxen-pulled wagon filled with brushwood which was set on fire. The wagon was then pulled by the oxen, who eventually also burned along with the wagon and the disgraced soothsayers. The sons of these Enarei were also all killed, but their daughters were spared.[11][12] Regalia [edit] The Enarei may have worn[vague] additional regalia such",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Young male slave dancer who dressed in feminine attire For the film, see Köçek (film). Not to be confused with Čoček. Köçek in Ottoman miniature. The köçek (plural köçekler) was typically a young, male, and physically attractive enslaved dancer[1] (rakkas), who usually cross-dressed in feminine attire, and was employed as an entertainer.[2] Roots [edit] \"Köçek troupe at a fair\" at Sultan Ahmed\u0027s 1720 celebration of his son\u0027s circumcision. Miniature from the Surname-i Vehbi, Topkapı Palace, Istanbul. Turkish köçek derives from Persian kūçak کوچک[3] .The culture of the köçek, which flourished from the 18th to the 19th century, had its origin in the customs in Ottoman palaces, and in particular in the harems. Its genres enriched both the music and the dance of the Ottomans.[2] The support of the Sultans was a key factor in its development, as the early stages of the art form was confined to palace circles.[4] From there the practice dispersed throughout the Empire by means of independent troupes.[2] Culture [edit] \"Performing Köçek\", illustration from Hubanname by Enderûnlu Fâzıl, 18th century A köçek would begin training around the age of seven or eight after he was circumcised and would be considered accomplished after about six years of study and practice. A dancer\u0027s career would last as long as he was clean shaven and retained his youthful appearance.[5] The dances, collectively known as köçek oyunu, blended elements from throughout the empire, most importantly Turkish (like Karsilamas and Kaşık Havası) and oriental elements. They performed to a particular genre of music known as köçekçe, which was performed in the form of suites in a given melody. It too was a mix of Sufi, Balkan and classical Anatolian influences, some of which survives in popular Turkish music today. The accompaniment included various percussion instruments, such as the davul-köçek, the davul being a large drum, one side covered with goat skin and the other in sheep skin, producing different tones. A köçek\u0027s skill would be judged not only on his dancing abilities but also on his proficiency with percussion instruments, especially a type of castagnette known as the çarpare.[2] The dancers were accompanied by an orchestra, featuring four to five each kaba kemençe and laouto as principal instruments, used exclusively for köçek suites.[6] There were also two singers. A köçek dance in the Ottoman seraglio (palace harem) involved one or two dozen köçeks and many musicians.[2] The occasions of their performances were wedding or circumcision celebrations, feasts and festivals, as well as the pleasure of the sultans and the aristocracy. The youths, often wearing heavy makeup, would curl their hair and wear it in long tresses under a small black or red velvet hat decorated with coins, jewels and gold. Their usual garb consisted of a tiny red embroidered velvet jacket with a gold-embroidered silk shirt, shalvar (baggy trousers), a long skirt and a gilt belt, knotted at the back. They were said to be \"sensuous, attractive, effeminate\", and their dancing \"sexually provocative\". Dancers minced and gyrated their hips in slow vertical and horizontal figure eights, rhythmically snapping their fingers and making suggestive gestures. Often acrobatics, tumbling and mock wrestling were part of the act.[7][8] Famous poets, such as Enderûnlu Fâzıl, wrote poems, and classical composers, such as the court musician Hammamizade İsmail Dede Efendi (1778–1846), composed köçekçes for celebrated köçeks. Many Istanbul meyhanes (nighttime taverns serving meze, rakı or wine) hired köçeks. Before starting their performance, the köçek danced among the spectators, to make them more excited. In the audience, competition for their attention often caused commotions and altercations. Men would allegedly go wild, breaking their glasses, shouting themselves voiceless, or fighting and sometimes killing each other vying for the opportunity to rape, molest, or otherwise force the children into sexual servitude.[9] This resulted in suppression of the practice under Sultan Abdulmejid I.[2] In 1805, there were approximately 600 köçek dancers working in the taverns of the Turkish capital. They were outlawed in 1837 due to fighting among audience members over the dancers.[10] With the suppression of harem culture under Sultan Abdulaziz (1861–1876) and Sultan Abdul Hamid II (1876–1908), köçek dance and music lost the support of its imperial patrons and gradually disappeared.[11] Köçeks were much more sought after than the çengi (\"belly dancers\"), their female counterparts. Some youths were known to have been killed by the çengi, who were extremely jealous of men\u0027s attention toward the boys.[9][12] Modern offshoots [edit] Today, köçek or zenne dancing is still seen in Turkey, although it has changed form to a more folkloric and less sexualized dance done by young, hairless youths, and is now done by adult men, still in skirts, beards a",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Self-replicating objects or patterns \"Going viral\" redirects here. For other uses, see Going Viral. Viral phenomena or viral sensations are objects or patterns that are able to replicate themselves or convert other objects into copies of themselves when these objects are exposed to them. Analogous to the way in which viruses propagate, the term viral pertains to a video, image, or written content spreading to numerous online users within a short time period.[1] This concept has become a common way to describe how thoughts, information, and trends move into and through a human population.[2] The popularity of viral media has been fueled by the rapid rise of social network sites,[3]: 17  wherein audiences—who are metaphorically described as experiencing \"infection\" and \"contamination\"—play as passive carriers rather than an active role to \u0027spread\u0027 content, making such content \"go viral\".[3]: 21  The term viral media differs from spreadable media as the latter refers to the potential of content to become viral. Memes are one known example of informational viral patterns. History [edit] Terminology [edit] Meme [edit] The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene as an attempt to explain memetics; or, how ideas replicate, mutate, and evolve.[4] When asked to assess this comparison, Lauren Ancel Meyers, a biology professor at the University of Texas, stated that \"memes spread through online social networks similarly to the way diseases do through offline populations.\"[5] This dispersion of cultural movements is shown through the spread of memes online, especially when seemingly innocuous or trivial trends spread and die in rapid fashion.[3]: 19, 27  For example, multiple viral videos featuring Vince McMahon promoted misogynistic messages and hate against Jewish people, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. The video depicted McMahon throwing money into the ring at a WWE event. This video was taken out of context to support misogynistic views for the Men Going Their Own Way Movement to gain attention according to research led by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.[6] This example demonstrates how public figures are turned into viral phenomena. Popular audio and video content on apps like TikTok are also used as memes of public figures. Viral [edit] The term viral pertains to a video, image, or written content spreading to numerous online users within a short time period.[1] If something goes viral, many people discuss it. Accordingly, Tony D. Sampson defines viral phenomena as spreadable accumulations of events, objects, and affects that are overall content built up by popular discourses surrounding network culture.[2]: 22  There is also a relationship to the biological notion of disease spread and epidemiology. In this context, \"going viral\" is similar to an epidemic spread, which occurs if more than one person is infected by a pathogen for every person infected. Thus, if a piece of content is shared with more than one person every time it is seen, then this will result in viral growth.[7] In Understanding Media (1964), philosopher Marshall McLuhan describes photography in particular, and technology in general, as having a potentially \"virulent nature.\"[8] In Jean Baudrillard\u0027s 1981 treatise Simulacra and Simulation, the philosopher describes An American Family, arguably the first \"reality\" television series, as a marker of a new age in which the medium of television has a \"viral, endemic, chronic, alarming presence.\"[9] Another formulation of the \u0027viral\u0027 concept includes the term media virus, or viral media, coined by Douglas Rushkoff, who defines it as a type of Trojan horse: \"People are duped into passing a hidden agenda while circulating compelling content.\"[3]: 17  Mosotho South-African media theorist Thomas Mofolo uses Rushkoff\u0027s idea to define viral as a type of virtual collective consciousness that primarily manifests via digital media networks and evolves into offline actions to produce a new social reality. Mofolo bases this definition on a study about how internet users involved in the Tunisian Arab Spring perceived the value of Facebook towards their revolution. Mofolo\u0027s understanding of the viral was first developed in a study on Global Citizen\u0027s #TogetherAtHome campaign and used to formulate a new theoretical framework called Hivemind Impact. Hivemind impact is a specific type of virality that is simulated via digital media networks with the goal of harnessing the virtual collective consciousness to take action on a social issue. For Mofolo, the viral eventually evolves into McLuhan\u0027s \u0027global village\u0027 when the virtual collective consciousness reaches a point of noogenesis that then becomes the noosphere. Content is more likely to reach this point, however, if it embodies certain characteristics that drive consumers to share.

Often used to refer to phalloplasty, metoidoplasty, or vaginectomy, sex reassignment surgery can also more broadly refer to many procedures an individual may have, such as chest reconstruction, hysterectomy, or oophorectomy. Gender-affirming surgery may be preceded by hormone treatment with testosterone. Chest reconstruction [edit] Chest reconstruction (\"top surgery\") can be an important component of transition in the transmasculine population that can substantially improve gender incongruence.[1] This might be done as a step in the process of treating distress due to a difference between experienced or expressed gender and sex assigned at birth (gender dysphoria). The procedure can help transgender men transition physically to their self-affirmed gender. These surgeries have similarities to gynecomastia surgeries for cisgender men,[2] breast reduction surgery for gigantomastia, and the separate mastectomies done for breast cancer.[3] Top surgery involves more than a mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer.[1] Special techniques are used to contour and reduce the chest wall, position the nipples and areola, and minimize scarring.[1] If the breast size is small, surgery that spares the skin, nipple and areola may be performed. This procedure minimizes scarring, has a faster healing time and usually preserves sensation in the nipples. During this surgery, incisions are made around the borders of the areolae and the surrounding skin. Breast tissue i",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Penetrative sexual activity for reproduction or sexual pleasure This article is primarily about humans. For other animals, see Animal sexual behaviour. For other uses, see Sex (disambiguation). \"Copulation\" redirects here. For copulation among other animals, see Copulation (zoology). For the biological functions of sexual intercourse, see Penile–vaginal intercourse. Sexual intercourse in the missionary position depicted by Édouard-Henri Avril (1892) Sexual intercourse (also coitus or copulation) is a sexual activity typically involving the insertion of the erect male penis inside the female vagina and followed by thrusting motions for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both.[1] This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex.[2][3] Sexual penetration is an instinctive form of sexual behaviour and psychology among humans. Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include anal sex (penetration of the anus by the penis), oral sex (penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the female genitalia), fingering (sexual penetration by the fingers) and penetration by use of a dildo (especially a strap-on dildo), and vibrators.[4][5] These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more people and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure. They can contribute to human bonding.[4][6] There are different views on what constitutes sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, which can impact views of sexual health.[7] Although sexual intercourse, particularly the term coitus, generally denotes penile–vaginal penetration and the possibility of creating offspring,[1] it also commonly denotes penetrative oral sex and penile–anal sex, especially the latter.[8] It usually encompasses sexual penetration, while non-penetrative sex has been labeled outercourse,[9] but non-penetrative sex may also be considered sexual intercourse.[4][10] Sex, often a shorthand for sexual intercourse, can mean any form of sexual activity.[7] Because people can be at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections during these activities, safer sex practices are recommended by health professionals to reduce transmission risk.[11][12] Various jurisdictions place restrictions on certain sexual acts, such as adultery, incest, sexual activity with minors, prostitution, rape, zoophilia, sodomy, premarital sex and extramarital sex. Religious beliefs also play a role in personal decisions about sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, such as decisions about virginity,[13][14] or legal and public policy matters. Religious views on sexuality vary significantly between different religions and sects of the same religion, though there are common themes, such as prohibition of adultery. Reproductive sexual intercourse between non-human animals is more often called copulation, and sperm may be introduced into the female\u0027s reproductive tract in non-vaginal ways among the animals, such as by cloacal copulation. For most non-human mammals, mating and copulation occur at the point of estrus (the most fertile period of time in the female\u0027s reproductive cycle), which increases the chances of successful impregnation.[15][16] However, bonobos, dolphins and chimpanzees are known to engage in sexual intercourse regardless of whether the female is in estrus, and to engage in sex acts with same-sex partners.[17] Like humans engaging in sexual activity primarily for pleasure, this behavior in these animals is also presumed to be for pleasure, and a contributing factor to strengthening their social bonds.[18] Behaviors See also: Human sexual activity and Human sexuality Definitions 19th-century erotic interpretation of Roman emperor Hadrian and Antinous engaged in anal intercourse, by Édouard-Henri Avril Sexual intercourse may be called coitus, copulation, coition, or intercourse. Coitus is derived from the Latin word coitio or coire, meaning \"a coming together or joining together\" or \"to go together\", and is known under different ancient Latin names for a variety of sexual activities, but usually denotes penile–vaginal penetration.[19] This is often called vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex.[2][20] Vaginal sex, and less often vaginal intercourse, may also denote any vaginal sexual activity, particularly if penetrative, including sexual activity between lesbian couples.[21][22] Copulation, by contrast, more often denotes the mating process, especially for non-human animals; it can mean a variety of sexual activities between opposite-sex or same-sex pairings,[23] but generally means the sexually reproductive act of transferring sperm from a male to a female or sexual procreation between a man and a woman.[23][24][25] Although sex and having sex also most commonly denote penile–vaginal intercourse,[26] sex can be significantly broad in its meaning and may cover any penetrative or non-penetrative sexual activity between two or more people.[7] The Wor",

The gunman, 21-year-old Patrick Wood Crusius, shot 45 people, killing 23[n 1] and injuring 22 others.[14][15] The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime.[16][17] The shooting has been described as the deadliest attack on Latinos in modern American history.[18][19] Crusius surrendered and was arrested and charged with capital murder in connection with the shooting. He posted a manifesto with white nationalist and anti-immigrant themes on the imageboard 8chan shortly before the attack.[20] The manifesto cites the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand earlier that year and the far-right conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement as inspiration for the attack. In 2023, Crusius pleaded guilty to 90 federal murder and hate crime charges,[21][22] and he was sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences.[23] Crusius pleaded guilty to the state charges on April 21, 2025, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[24] Events [edit] Preceding [edit] Crusius standing in the Walmart prior to the shooting Around midnight before the shooting, Crusius left his grandparents\u0027 house in Allen, Texas. Throughout the entire night, he drove 650 miles (1,050 km) to El Paso, Texas. He stopped his car for gas and energy drinks twice throughout the journey. The next morning, Crusius eventually made it to El Paso at around 8 a.m. For roughly an hour, he drove around El Paso with no clear target in mind. He also stopped at a pizzeria but left because it was closed. He arrived at the Walmart near the Cielo Vista Mall on the east side of El Paso at around 9 a.m. Crusius entered the store and walked around for half an hour to carry out a reconnaissance of the building. He went back to his car and waited for a few minutes before entering the store again to purchase an orange. He ate the orange in the store before heading back to his car.[25] At 10:15 a.m., while sitting in his car, Crusius opened his laptop, went on the imageboard 8chan, and started a thread titled, \"ITS TIME\". Accompanied with text, he accidentally uploaded a PDF file of a discipline letter sent by his college for attending a class while drunk.[citation needed] Five minutes later, he posted a reply in the thread and uploaded the PDF file of his manifesto.[25] At 10:37 a.m., Crusius walked to the back of his car to gear up and pull out a WASR-10 rifle,[26] a semi-automatic civilian version of the AKM, from the trunk. A minute later, he closed the trunk and began opening fire.[27] Shooting [edit] Crusius first killed a woman pushing a shopping cart before shooting several people near and at a fundraising event for the El Paso Fusion girls soccer team outside the store. During this initial shooting, Crusius killed three people (including a man who died eight months later) and injured six in the parking lot.[28][29][30] The store manager witnessed Crusius firing in the parking lot prior to entering the crowded store. He issued a \"Code Brown\", designating an active shooter, to his employees, who began helping customers evacuate or hide.[31][32] Approximately 3,000 people were in the mall\u0027s complex at the time of the shooti",

    "content": "boi [boi] October 25, 2018 What does boi mean? Boi is an alternate spelling of boy used to describe boys, yes, but also men, girls, women, and things that aren’t even human … Where does boi come from? You may know boi from Dat Boi, a 2015 meme featuring a frog on a unicycle. Know Your Meme But, what about that time in the early 1990s, when Georgia rapper Antwan André Patton adopted the stage name Big Boi before going on to become one half of Outkast. This spelling of boi was in line with other street spellings, like in the 1991 film Boyz in the Hood. Kind of like phat or thicc, deliberate slang misspellings. Boi is also likely a lexical middle finger to white people who insult adult black men by calling them boy … In the mid-to-late 1990s, boi came to mean a more sensitive form of masculinity as it was taken up by skateboarding, rave, and, eventually emo scenes. Boi was also adopted by young women, some of whom identified as gay, in skateboarding. This helped boi spread in the 2000s for young, hip, genderqueer and trans individuals who presented as masculine. From here, boi moved into the the larger LGBTQ culture, adopted by young gay men, especially so-called “bottoms” or “subs” in the BDSM community. The meme-ing of boi began in 2014 with a news broadcast screenshot of a “Wanted” photo. It featured a digitally added mustache and replaced the wanted person’s name with dat boi, or that boy. In 2015, a Tumblr user, Phalania, made a now-deleted but internet-famous post: “Here come dat boi. O shit waddup!” Know Your Meme Meanwhile, an absurd late 1990s animation of a frog on a unicycle was creeping around in the caves of the internet. In April 2016, the phrase “here come dat boi” and that weird frog were brought together, in pure internet randomness and absurdity, on a Facebook meme page to create Dat Boi, which went massively viral—though it was also criticized as an appropriation of black and queer culture. Examples of boi God accepts ALL genders! #genderfluid #lgbtq #genderqueer #boi #tomboy #boygirl #girlboy #genderdiversity @all4godsword, May, 2016 Damn y’all a boi is crazy, can’t believe he’s trying to do this right now #FuckTrump #trumptext @_CristainTeran, October, 2018 morning-train, Tumblr There does seem to be a flexibility in gender roles that is refreshing: some bois date butches, some date femmes, some date other bois, some transition and use male pronouns, some remain female-identified. It’s become non-political in terms of feminism and homosexuality, but in terms of gender they seem to be filling the spectrum from male to female and bridging the gender gap. PlainT, Queering the Nerd, September 2014 Who uses boi? Big Boi continues to make music … Avril Lavigne celebrated her “Sk8r Boi” in one of the most popular songs of 2002. Boi also remains a self-empowered self-identifier in genderqueer communities. Ya boi Owen feeling cozy, warm, and safe atm. #selfie #genderfluid #genderqueer #nonbinary #ftm #ftmtransgender #trans pic.twitter.com/D0nSbK23ky — OwenWallaceGetty (@QueerOwenGetty) September 21, 2017 Memers never miss a chance to find new ways to insert boi into both new and existing memes, usually intending boi as a funny misspelling or in reference to the dat boi meme. Boi, in meme, has humorously come to stand for any person or object. https://twitter.com/Nicole_Cliffe/status/1054402651478093824 Imgflip NOTE This is not meant to be a formal definition of boi like most terms we define on Dictionary.com, but is rather an informal word summary that hopefully touches upon the key aspects of the meaning and usage of boi that will help our users expand their word mastery.",

It may be psychological or physical and motivated by biphobia, gayphobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, and transphobia. Influencing factors may be cultural, religious,[3][4][5] or political mores and biases.[6] Currently, homosexual acts are legal in almost all Western countries, and in many of these countries violence against LGBTQ people is classified as a hate crime.[7] Outside the West, many countries are deemed potentially dangerous to their LGBTQ population due to both discriminatory legislation and threats of violence. These include most African countries (except South Africa), most Asian countries (except some LGBTQ-friendly countries as Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines), and some former communist countries such as Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia and Serbia.[5] Such violence is often associated with religious condemnation of homosexuality or conservative social attitudes that portray homosexuality as an illness or a character flaw.[3][4] Historically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to male homosexuality, termed \"sodomy\". During the Middle Ages and the early modern period, the penalty for sodomy was usually death.[8] During the modern period (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment. There was a drop in locations where homosexual acts remained illegal from 2009 when there were 80 countries worldwide (notably throughout the Middle East, Central Asia and in most of Africa, but also in some of the Caribbean and ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Fantasia Fair (also known as FanFair)[1] is a week-long conference for cross-dressers, transgender and gender questioning people held every October in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a small Portuguese fishing village and largely gay and lesbian tourist village on the very tip of Cape Cod.[2] This annual event is the longest-running transgender conference in the United States and it provides a week for attendees to experiment with gender-role identities and presentations in a safe and affirming community. The goal of the conference is to create a safe space in which crossdressers, transgender and transsexual people, and nonbinary-gendered people are accepted without judgement, can interact with their peers, and can advocate for their rights. In November, 1980 the event was featured in an article by D. Keith Mano in Playboy magazine[3] and has in ensuing years has continued to generate publicity.[4][5][6] At its inception in 1975,[7] Fantasia Fair was ten days long and considered an event for heterosexual cross-dressers. Most of the programs focused on personal presentation, and the registration fee, which included housing, was expensive. By the 1990s, however, the nature of the attendees were more diverse, including trans men and trans women, cross-dressers, and genderqueer people of every sexual orientation. Reflecting this move toward inclusivity, the event\u0027s name has been changed to TransWeek.[8] In October, 2024, the event will celebrate its 50th anniversary.[9] Fantasia Fair\u0027s parent organization was the Outreach Institute for Gender Studies (originally the Human Outreach and Achievement Institute), founded in 1975. Since 2000 the parent organization has been Real Life Experiences, a nonprofit corporation which makes annual awards to transgender pioneers at a banquet held during the Fair. Many Fantasia Fair events are open to the public for free or at low cost. These include six daily keynote addresses, a dinner with entertainment, and the Fantasia Fair Fashion and Follies shows. A number of scholarships are awarded annually. Many documents regarding Fantasia Fair, from its inception until current day, are archived in the Rikki Swin Collection in the University of Victoria Transgender Archives, in the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,[10] and online at the Digital Transgender Archive. Partners, Professionals and Allies [edit] Fantasia Fair has always emphasized and supported the spouses, family members, and allies of transgender and other gender nonconforming people and considered them full partners in the event. Discounts have routinely been given to spouses and every year one or more helping professionals work with trans families, holding workshops in a program track specifically for those in relationships with trans and gender nonbinary people. Fantasia Fair has always attracted and welcomed helping professionals, many of whom attend for many years. Many of the trans attendees are themselves helping professionals and bring specialized knowledge to the event. Professionals include speech and voice therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, surgeons, academics in a variety of disciplines, and gender theorists. Events [edit] Fantasia Fair offers \"a myriad of events and activities\" [11] including luncheons, award banquets, daily keynote addresses, and a wealth of workshops on topics including dance, gender change, identity, community building, legal and medical issues, and pronoun usage. Workshops on cosmetics and consultations on hair, makeup, clothing, voice, and gender confirmation surgeries are offered for those who desire them. There is an evening fashion show and a Fantasia Fair Follies talent show, and opportunities for nightlife and outings like whale watching, dunes tours, and history walks. The Unitarian Universalist Meeting House of Provincetown holds a special trans-inclusive service on the last day of Fantasia Fair. Conference attendees are encouraged to participate in as many activities as possible, but are under no obligation to attend all, or any of the offered events. Many of the events take place in the Crown and Anchor restaurant, bar, and nightclub, but Fantasia Fair encompasses the entire town. Attendees stay in a variety of small inns and bed \u0026 breakfast establishments and many rent apartments or houses. Workshops and lunches are held in a variety of locations. Promotion [edit] In its early years, promotion of Fantasia Fair was, at times, difficult, due to the discriminatory attitude and laws surrounding transsexualism, transvestism, and transgenderism. Promotion was carried out in a number of ways: flyers were sent out, usually in the February before the Fair, which is held in October. Brochures were made available and mailed to homes of past participants, and newsletters were mailed out in April, June, and September. Ads and articles were posted in several publications. Fantas",

    "title": "Gender neutrality - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Avoiding distinguishing based on gender Gender neutrality (adjective form: gender-neutral), also known as gender-neutralism or the gender neutrality movement, is the idea that policies, language, and other social institutions (social structures or gender roles)[1] should avoid distinguishing roles according to people\u0027s sex or gender. This is in order to avoid discrimination arising from the impression that there are social roles for which one gender is more suited than another. The disparity in gender equality throughout history has had a significant impact on many aspects of society, including marketing, toys, education and parenting techniques. In order to increase gender neutrality in recent years, there has been a societal emphasis on utilizing inclusive language and advocating for equality.[citation needed] In policy [edit] Proponents of gender neutrality may support public policies designed to eliminate gender distinctions. Gender neutrality in the law has changed the nature of custody disputes, making it more likely that men will be awarded custody of their children in the event of a divorce.[2] The legal definition of gender has been a controversial topic to transgender people; in some countries, in order to be legally defined as a new gender, people must first undergo sex reassignment surgery resulting in sterilization.[3] California joined Oregon in its effort to recognize gender neutrality. On 15 October 2017, California governor Jerry Brown signed new legislation into law that allows persons the option to select gender-neutral on state identification cards.[4] On 9 October 2021, governor Gavin Newsom signed California Assembly Bill 1084 requiring many department stores in California to maintain a gender neutral children\u0027s section.[5] Legal frameworks for determining parentage have traditionally relied on gendered concepts, but these approaches face challenges as family structures diversify. Following the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States, courts and legislatures have had to reconsider how parentage rules apply when they cannot rely on traditional gender-based assumptions. This has prompted exploration of alternative bases for legal parentage, including intention, function, and agreement rather than solely biology or marriage.[6] Studies show that workplace leave policies using terms like \"maternity leave\" and \"paternity leave\" create problems for parents who don\u0027t fit traditional gender categories. Research by Holroyd and Cull found that many people feel forced to accept incorrect gender labels just to access their rightful benefits. According to their research, it makes more sense to just use phrases like \"parental leave\" or \"family leave\" for everyone. While businesses may continue to collect volunteer gender data to address any prejudice, this simple move helps all parents feel valued. The strategy broadens the scope of policies while continuing to work for equitable treatment for all parents.[7] Gender blindness [edit] Main article: Gender-blind Gender blindness is the practice of not distinguishing people by gender.[8] Someone who is gender blind does not necessarily side with ideas of movements found within gender-related biases, though these accounts are debatable.[9] For example, gender blindness can take place while hiring new candidates for a job position. The employer more so focuses on the resume and cover letter rather than focusing on their gender. This reduces gender-bias, meaning there is a preference of one gender to be favored over the other in certain topics and roles.[10] Gender-neutral language [edit] Main article: Gender-neutral language Gender-neutral language, gender-inclusive language, inclusive language or gender neutrality is a form of linguistic prescriptivism that aims to eliminate (or neutralize) reference to gender in terms that describe people. This can involve discouragement of the use of gender-specific job titles, such as policeman/policewoman, fireman, stewardess, chairman, and, arguably, in favor of corresponding gender-neutral terms such as police officer, firefighter, flight attendant and chairperson (or chair). Other gender-specific terms, such as actor and actress, may be replaced by the originally male term (actor used for either gender). The language used in standardized tests can influence gender-based performance gaps. A study of Israel\u0027s college entrance examinations showed that using more inclusive language forms reduced the gender performance gap in quantitative sections by approximately one-fifth. It is possible that conventional gendered language may cause disadvantages through stereotypes, as the researchers found that this linguistic adjustment particularly boosted women\u0027s performance without having a negative impact on men\u0027s findings.[11] The practice of gender-neutral language is highly encouraged among law students and the Supreme Court of the United States.

    "title": "Fruit (slang) - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Number of slang terms Fruit, fruity, and fruitcake, as well as its many variations, are slang or even sexual slang terms which have various origins. These terms have often been used derogatorily to refer to LGBT people.[1][2] Usually used as pejoratives, the terms have also been re-appropriated as insider terms of endearment within LGBT communities.[3] Many modern pop culture references within the gay nightlife like \"Fruit Machine\" and \"Fruit Packers\" have been appropriated for reclaiming usage, similar to queer.[4][5][6][7] Origin and historical usage [edit] In A Dictionary of Epithets and Terms of Address author Leslie Dunkling traces the friendly use of the phrase old fruit (and rarely old tin of fruit) to the 1920s in Britain, possibly deriving from the phrase fruit of the womb. In the United States, however, both fruit and fruitcake are seen as negative, with fruitcake likely originating from the idiom nutty as a fruitcake \u0027crazy\u0027.[8] Costermongers and Cockney rhyming slang [edit] The Coster\u0027s Mansion, 1899 sheet music A costermonger was a street seller of fruit and vegetables. The term, which derived from the words costard (a type of apple)[9] and monger, i.e. \"seller\", came to be particularly associated with the \"barrow boys\" of London who would sell their produce from a wheelbarrow or wheeled market stall. Costermongers have existed in London since at least the 16th century, when they were mentioned by Shakespeare and Marlowe, and were probably most numerous during the Victorian era, when there were said to be over 30,000 in 1860. They gained a fairly unsavoury reputation for their \"low habits, general improvidence, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar slang language\".[10] Two examples of their slang are referring to potatoes as \"bog-oranges\" likely developed from the phrase \"Irish fruit\" also referring to potatoes[11] and \"cool the delo nammow\" which means \u0027watch out for that old woman\u0027 with the words essentially backwards; cool (look), delo (old) and nammow (woman).[12] Out of the East End of London traditional Cockney rhyming slang developed, which works by taking two words that are related through a short phrase and using the first word to stand for a word that rhymes with the second. For instance, the most popular of these rhyming slang phrases used throughout Britain is probably \"telling porkies\" meaning \"lies\" as \"pork pies\" rhymes with lies. \"Alright, me old fruit?\" is an example of this as \"fruit gum\" is translated as meaning \"chum\" (a friend or acquaintance).[13] Cassell\u0027s Dictionary of Slang traces uses of fruit meaning an easy victim in the late 19th century and also as an eccentric person (along with fruitball, fruit basket and fruit merchant).[14] As gay slang [edit] Fruit as gay slang or slur is amongst the lexicon of the cant slang Polari used in the gay subculture in Britain, which has become more mainstream with transcontinental travel and online communication.[15] There is still debate about how Polari originated but its origins can be traced back to at least the 19th century[16] and has multiple origins and routes of dissemination with researchers finding a relatively small base of less than two dozen common (universal words) supplemented by regional phrases. It is believed to be passed on near exclusively by oral history and teaching and was found in traveling professions such as those in the sailing and traveling entertainment industries (like minstrel shows and circuses). In Polari, fruit means queen, which at the time and still today is a term for gay men and can be used positively or negatively depending on the speaker, usage and intent.[17][18] Several origins of the word fruit being used to describe gay men are possible, and most stem from the linguistic concepts of insulting a man by comparing him to or calling him a woman. In Edita Jodonytë and Palmina Morkienë\u0027s research On Sexist Attitudes in English they note \"female-associated words become totally derogatory when applied to males\"[19] and “[W]hen language oppresses it does so by any means that disparage and belittle.”[20] Comparing a gay man to fruit, soft and tender, effeminate, like a woman has possibly gained near universal use because both LGBT people and fruit are found nearly everywhere.[21] In One of the Boys: Homosexuality in the Military During World War II author Paul Jackson writes \"a number of words that originally referred to prostitutes came to be applied to effeminate or queer men - \"queen, punk, gay, faggot, fairy, and fruit.\"[22] From the 1857 \"Dictionary of Obsolete and Provincial English: Containing Words from the English Writers Previous to the Nineteenth Century Which Are No Longer In Use, Or Are Not Used In The Same Sense. And Words Which Are Now Used Only In The Provincial Dialects\" (e.g. all parts of England other than London) several routes seem likely, cockney was",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Pejorative slur used against effeminate boys and men For other uses, see Sissy (disambiguation). \"Sissies\" redirects here. For the band, see The Sissies. Sissy (derived from sister), also sissy baby, sissy boy, sissy man, sissy pants, etc., is a pejorative term for a boy or man who does not demonstrate masculine traits, is effeminate and shows possible signs of fragility. Generally, sissy implies a lack of courage, strength, athleticism, coordination, testosterone, male libido, and stoicism. A man might also be considered a sissy for being interested in stereotypically feminine hobbies or employment (e.g., being fond of fashion), displaying effeminate behavior, being unathletic or being homosexual.[1] Sissy is also the male counterpart of tomboy (a girl with traits or interests of the opposite gender), but carries more strongly negative connotations. Research published in 2015 suggests that the terms are asymmetrical in their power to stigmatize: sissy is almost always pejorative and conveys greater severity, while tomboy rarely causes as much concern but also elicits pressure to conform to social expectations.[2] In some communities, especially ones whose members are prominently part of the later generations of Millennial[3] and Generation Z, highly effeminate males are referred to as \"femboys\" (feminine boy), a term which aims to provide a way to refer to effeminate males without negative connotations. Diminutive term [edit] Sissy is also a term of endearment used as a diminutive for the female given name Cecilia. Its usage as a diminutive for Cecilia dates back to at least the late 19th century. Its usage is explicitly called out in Charles Dickens\u0027 Hard Times: For These Times.[4] However, it has since fallen out of favor, coinciding with the rise in its usage as a pejorative.[citation needed] History and usage [edit] The term sissy has historically been used among school children as a \"relentlessly negative\" insult, implying immaturity and gender or sexual deviance.[5] It has been identified as sexist in guidance issued to schools in the United Kingdom[6] and described as \"just as unacceptable as racist and homophobic language.\"[7] The terms gender creative,[8] pink boy,[9] and tomgirl[10] have been suggested as polite alternatives. The Japanese word bishōnen (literally \"beautiful youth\") and the Korean word kkonminam (literally \"flower boy\") are also polite terms for a man or boy with gentle or feminine attributes. The word sissy in its original meaning of \"sister\" entered American English around 1840–1850 and acquired its pejorative meaning around 1885–1890; the verb sissify appeared in 1900–1905.[11] In comparison, the word tomboy is approximately three centuries older, dating to 1545–1555.[12] By the 1930s, \"there was no more damning insult than to be called a sissy\" and the word was widely used by American football coaches and sports writers to disparage rival teams and encourage ferocious player behavior.[13] The use of the word sissy was \"ubiquitous\" among delinquent American youth of the 1930s; the term was used to provoke boys to join gangs, demean boys who violated group norms, force compliance with the mandates of masculinity, and justify violence (including sexual violence) against younger and weaker children.[14] Good students were taunted as sissies and clothing styles associated with higher social classes were demeaned as sissified. Among members of a Detroit, Michigan youth gang in 1938–39, sissy was \"the ultimate slur\" used to tease and taunt other boys, as a rationalization for violence against rivals, and as an excuse for not observing the dicta of middle-class decorum and morality.[14] By the late 1980s, some men began to reclaim the term sissy for themselves.[15] The spelling variation cissy was used in British English, at least prior to the mid 1970s.[16] In the United States, the Comedy Central television series South Park inverted its meaning in a 2014 episode titled \"The Cissy\", which lampooned the controversy over transgender students\u0027 use of school restrooms;[17] in the episode, a restroom initially designated for use by transgender students is later re-designated as \"the cissy bathroom\" for use by transphobic cisgender students. As threats to masculine dominance [edit] In China, men who display feminine characteristics are sometimes perceived as threats to masculine power. For example, in 2018, official Chinese state media derided \"sissy pants\" young men (who use makeup, are slender, and wear androgynous clothing) as part of a \"sickly\" culture that threatened the future of the nation by undermining its militaristic image.[18][19] In 2021, China\u0027s Ministry of Education issued guidelines for the \"cultivation of students\u0027 masculinity\" to \"prevent the feminization of male adolescents\" through sports, physical education, and \"health education\" in schools.[20][21] In 2021, the National Radio and Television Administration of Chin",

The most prolific and well-known of these communities is the Asexual Visibility and Education Network, which was founded in 2001 by David Jay.[5][15] Definition, identity and relationships Because there is significant variation among those who identify as asexual, the term asexuality can encompass broad definitions.[16] Researchers generally define asexuality as the lack of sexual attraction or the lack of interest in sexual activity,[5][14][17] though specific definitions vary—the term may be used to refer to individuals with low or absent sexual behavior or exclusively romantic non-sexual partnerships in addition to low or absent sexual desire or attraction.[14][18] The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), an online forum dedicated to asexuality, defines an asexual as \"someone who does not experience sexual attraction\", as well as adding that asexuality \"at its core\" is \"just a word that people use to help figure themselves out\", and encourages people to use the term asexual to define themselves \"as long as it makes sense to do so\".[19] Asexuality is often abbreviated as ace, a phonetic shortening of asexual,[20] and the community as a whole is likewise referred to as the ace community.[21][22] Relationships See also: Queerplatonic relationship Simplified diagram of the aromantic and asexual spectra Despite lacking sexual attractio",

For the slang term for the human penis, see Cock (slang). For other uses, see C-word. \"Cunny\" redirects here. For other uses, see Cunny (disambiguation). The word \"cunt\" used in a medical textbook from 1380 Cunt (/kʌnt/ ⓘ) is a vulgar word for the vulva in its primary sense, and it is used in a variety of ways, including as a term of disparagement. It is often used as a disparaging and obscene term for a woman in the United States, an unpleasant or objectionable person (regardless of gender) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, or a contemptible man in Australia and New Zealand.[1][2][3][4] In Australia and New Zealand, it can also be a neutral or positive term when used with a positive qualifier (e.g., \"He\u0027s a good cunt\").[5][6] The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses. History The earliest known use of the word, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was as part of a placename: an Oxford street called Gropecunt Lane, c. 1230, now by the name of Grove Passage or Magpie Lane. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century.[7] The word was not considered vulgar in the Middle Ages, but became so during the seventeenth century,[8] and it was omitted from dictionaries from the late eighteenth century until the 1960s.[9] Etymology This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Cunt\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (January 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The etymology of cunt is a matter of debate,[10] but most sources consider the word to have derived from a Germanic word (Proto-Germanic *kuntō, stem *kuntōn-), which appeared as kunta in Old Norse. Scholars are uncertain of the origin of the Proto-Germanic form itself.[11] There are cognates in most Germanic languages, most of which also have the same meaning as the English cunt, such as the Swedish, Faroese and Nynorsk kunta; West Frisian and Middle Low German kunte; another Middle Low German kutte; Middle High German kotze (meaning \"prostitute\"); modern German kott; Middle Dutch conte; modern Dutch words kut (same meaning) and kont (\"butt\", \"arse\"); and perhaps Old English cot. The etymology of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed. It may have arisen by Grimm\u0027s law operating on the Proto-Indo-European root *gen/gon \"create, become\" seen in gonads, genital, gamete, genetics, gene, or the Proto-Indo-European root *gʷneh₂/guneh₂ \"woman\" (Greek: gunê, seen in gynaecology). Similarly, its use in England likely evolved from the Latin word cunnus (\"vulva\"), or one of its derivatives French con, Spanish coño, and Galician/Portuguese cona.[12] Other Latin words related to cunnus are cuneus (\"wedge\") and its derivative cunēre (\"to fasten with a wedge\", (figurative) \"to squeeze in\"), leading to English words such as cuneiform (\"wedge-shaped\"). In Middle English, cunt appeared with many spellings, such as coynte, cunte and queynte, which did not always reflect the actual pronunciation of the word. The word, in its modern meaning, is attested in Middle English. Proverbs of Hendyng, a manuscript from some time before 1325, includes the advice:[13] Ȝeue þi cunte to cunnig and craue affetir wedding. (Give your cunt wisely and make [your] demands after the wedding.) Offensiveness Generally The word cunt is generally regarded in English-speaking countries as profanity and unsuitable for normal public discourse. It has been described as \"the most heavily tabooed word of all English words\",[14][15] although John Ayto, editor of the Oxford Dictionary of Slang, says \"nigger\" is more taboo.[16] Feminist perspectives Flyposting of the activist platform Courageous Cunts on an urban wall Santa Cruz Women\u0027s March 2017 Some American feminists of the 1970s sought to eliminate disparaging terms for women, including \"bitch\" and \"cunt\".[17] In the context of pornography, Catharine MacKinnon argued that use of the word acts to reinforce a dehumanisation of women by reducing them to mere body parts;[18] and in 1979 Andrea Dworkin described the word as reducing women to \"the one essential – \u0027cunt: our essence ... our offence\u0027\".[18] Despite criticisms, there is a movement among feminists that seeks to reclaim cunt not only as acceptable, but as an honorific, in much the same way that queer has been reappropriated by LGBT people and nigger has been by some African Americans.[19] Proponents include artist Tee Corinne in The Cunt Coloring Book (1975); Eve Ensler in \"Reclaiming Cunt\" from The Vagina Monologues (1996); and Inga Muscio in her book, Cunt: A Declaration of Independence (1998).[20] Germaine Greer, the feminist writer and professor of English w",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Downblouse) Separation between human breasts A woman\u0027s cleavage Cleavage is the narrow depression or hollow between the breasts of a woman. The superior portion of cleavage may be accentuated by clothing such as a low-cut neckline that exposes the division, and often the term is used to describe the low neckline itself, instead of the term décolletage. Joseph Breen, head of the U.S. film industry\u0027s Production Code Administration, coined the term in its current meaning when evaluating the 1943 film The Outlaw, starring Jane Russell. The term was explained in Time magazine on August 5, 1946. It is most commonly used in the parlance of Western female fashion to refer to necklines that reveal or emphasize décolletage (display of the upper breast area). The visible display of cleavage can provide erotic pleasure for those who are sexually attracted to women, though this does not occur in all cultures. Explanations for this effect have included evolutionary psychology and dissociation from breastfeeding. Since at least the 15th century, women in the Western world have used their cleavage to flirt, attract, make political statements (such as in the Topfreedom movement), and assert power. In several parts of the world, the advent of Christianity and Islam saw a sharp decline in the amount of cleavage which was considered socially acceptable. In many cultures today, cleavage exposure is considered unwelcome or is banned legally. In some areas like European beaches and among many indigenous populations across the world, cleavage exposure is acceptable; conversely, even in the Western world it is often discouraged in daywear or in public spaces. In some cases, exposed cleavage can be a target for unwanted voyeuristic photography or sexual harassment. Cleavage-revealing clothes started becoming popular in the Christian West as it came out of the Early Middle Ages and enjoyed significant prevalence during Mid-Tang-era China, Elizabethan-era England, and France over many centuries, particularly after the French Revolution. But in Victorian-era England and during the flapper period of Western fashion, it was suppressed. Cleavage came vigorously back to Western fashion in the 1950s, particularly through Hollywood celebrities and lingerie brands. The consequent fascination with cleavage was most prominent in the U.S., and countries heavily influenced by the U.S. With the advent of push-up and underwired bras that replaced corsets of the past, the cleavage fascination was propelled by these lingerie manufacturers. By the early 2020s, dramatization of cleavage started to lose popularity along with the big lingerie brands. At the same time cleavage was sometimes replaced with other types of presentation of clothed breasts, like sideboobs and underboobs. Many women enhance their cleavage through the use of things like brassières, falsies and corsetry, as well as surgical breast augmentation using saline or silicone implants and hormone therapy. Workouts, yoga, skin care, makeup, jewelry, tattoos and piercings are also used to embellish the cleavage. Male cleavage (also called heavage), accentuated by low necklines or unbuttoned shirts, is a film trend in Hollywood and Bollywood. Some men also groom their chests. Etymology [edit] Jane Russell in The Outlaw (1943). Director Howard Hughes\u0027 overemphasizing of her cleavage prompted the Motion Picture Association of America to take actions against the film and make the first use of the term cleavage in association with breasts.[1][2][3] Hughes and Russell are considered pioneers of exaggerated cleavage in movies.[4] For the film, Hughes designed a prototype for an underwire bra to give Russell \"five and one-quarter inches\" long cleavage.[5] The word cleavage was first used in the early 19th century in geology and mineralogy to mean the tendency of crystals, minerals, and rocks to split along definite planes. By the mid-19th century, it was generally used to mean splitting along a line of division into two or more parts.[1][6] In the 1940s, Joseph Breen, head of the U.S. Production Code Administration, applied the term to breasts in reference to actor Jane Russell\u0027s costumes and poses in the 1943 movie The Outlaw. The term was also applied in the evaluation of the British films The Wicked Lady (1945), starring Margaret Lockwood and Patricia Roc; Bedelia (1946), also starring Lockwood; and Pink String and Sealing Wax (1945), starring Googie Withers. This use of the term was first covered in a Time article titled \"Cleavage \u0026 the Code\" on August 5, 1946, as a \"Johnston Office (the popular name for Motion Picture Association of America office at the time[7]) trade term for the shadowed depression dividing an actress\u0027 bosom into two distinct sections.\"[1][2][8][9] The word cleavage is made of the root verb cleave \u0027to split\u0027 (from Old English clifian and Middle English clevien; cleft in the past tense) and the suffix -ag",

The practice is most common in patriarchal northern Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro, where burrnesha are recognized under the tribal Kanun law, but also exists, or has existed, to a lesser extent in other parts of the western Balkans, including Bosnia, Dalmatia (Croatia), Serbia and North Macedonia.[2] In times when women had a prescribed role, burrnesha gave up their preexisting sexual, reproductive and social identities to acquire the same freedoms as men. They could dress as men, be head of the household, move freely in social situations, and take work traditionally open only to men.[3] National Geographic\u0027s Taboo estimated in 2002 that there were fewer than 102 Albanian sworn virgins left.[4] As of 2022[update], while there were no exact figures, twelve burrnesha were estimated to remain in Northern Albania and Kosovo.[3] Part of a series on the History of Albania Early History Prehistoric Albania Origin of the Albanians Christianization of Albania Illyria Illyrians Macedonia Illyricum Medieval Byzantine rule Bulgarian rule Principality of Arbanon Angevin Kingdom of Albania Principality of Albania Serbian rule Principalities League of Lezhë Venetian Albania Albanian nobility Albanian cities during the Middle Ages Early modern Principality of Mirdita Ottoman Albania Islamization of Albania Sanjak of Albania Sanjak of Scutari Sanjak of Dibra Scutari Vilayet Janina Vilayet Manastir Vilayet Kosovo Vilayet Pashaliks Massacre of the beys National Awakening Revolts of 1833–1839 Revolt of 1843–1844 Revolt of 1845 Revolt of 1847 League of Prizren League of Peja Revolt of 1910 Malissori uprising Battle of Deçiq Revolt of 1912 Albanian Vilayet Declaration of Independence Late modern Independent Albania Provisional Government Congress of Trieste International Commission of Control Balkan Wars Principality Peasant Revolt World War I in Albania Republic of Central Albania Italian expedition Republic of Korçë Republic of Mirdita Congress of Durrës Vlora War Congress of Lushnjë Treaties of Tirana June Revolution Principality (Regency) Albanian Republic Albanian Kingdom Albania under Italy German occupation of Albania World War II in Albania Second League of Prizren Liberation Day Socialist Albania Contemporary Post-communism 1997 Albanian civil unrest Republic of Albania Topics Art Constitution Economy Monarchs Military Names Timeline v t e Terminology [edit] Other terms for a sworn virgin include, in English, Albanian virgin or avowed virgin; in Albanian: burrnesha, vajzë e betuar (most common today, and used in situations in which the parents make the decision when the person is a baby or child), and various words cognate with \"virgin\" – virgjineshë, virgjereshë, verginesa, virgjin, vergjinesha;[5] in Bosnian: tobelija (bound by a vow);[6] in Serbo-Croatian: virdžina; in Serbian: ostajnica (she who stays); in Turkish: sadik, meaning \"loyal, devoted\".[5] Origins [edit] Part of a series on Albanian tribes Tribes and regions Malësia e Madhe Hoti Gruda Kelmendi Shkreli Rrjolli Kastrati Trieshi Koja Marsheni Tuzi Gruemiri Reçi Lohja Lepuroshi Boga Dukagjin Highlands Bobi Shala Shoshi Shllaku Dushmani Toplana Mavriqi Mazreku Prekali Pult Kiri Plani Xhani Suma Highlands of Gjakova Krasniqi Nikaj Mërturi Gashi Bytyçi Morina Puka-Mirdita Berisha Mirdita Puka Malziu Thaçi Qerreti Kabashi Selita Dukagjini Upper Drin Luma Lura Arrëni Dibra Sopa Kastrioti Zadrimë - Lezha highlands Zadrima Bushati Renesi Vela Bulgëri Kryezezi Manatia Mati - Kruja highlands Progani Gjonima Myzeqe Lalë Muzaka Albania Veneta Pamalioti Mahine Kryethi Kakarriqi Brda-Zeta Bukumiri Bratonishi Bytadosi Kuçi Macure Malonšići Mataguzi Mugoša Pipri Palabardhi Rogami Vasaj Old Montenegro Goljemadi Herzegovina - Ragusan hinterland Burmazi Mataruga Španji Kriči Epirus/Chameria Bua Kurveleshi Losha Malakasioi Mazaraki Spata Zenevisi Souliotes Law code Kanun (Albanian customary law) Concepts Zjarri Vatër Muranë Ora/Fatia Besa Gjakmarrja Hospitality Bukë, Kripë e Zemër Honour History Bajrak Albanian National Awakening Malissori uprising Kachak movement Reconciliation Movement in 1990 Culture Paganism Dheu Qielli Dielli Hëna Prende Zjarri Vatër Vitore Drangue vs Kulshedra Ora/Fatia Zana Gjamë/Vajtim Muranë Epic poetry (Lahutë · Çifteli · Fyelli · Kângë Kreshnikësh) Kângë majekrahi Dances war dances Sworn virgins Kulla Oda Clothing (Brez · Fustanella · Opinga · Qeleshe · Xhamadan · Xhubleta.·Çorape) Traditional tattooing v t e Sworn virgins have been documented ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia English euphemism for the human penis Dick Pronunciation /dɪk/[1] Definition In a literal sense A human penis Figuratively A rude, abrasive, inconsiderate, or otherwise contemptible individual (derogatory) Detective (See also § Other slang) Dick (/dɪk/)[1] is a common English slang word for the human penis.[2] It is also used by extension for a variety of slang purposes, generally considered vulgar, including as a verb to describe sexual activity and as a pejorative term for individuals who are considered to be rude, abrasive, inconsiderate, or otherwise contemptible.[2] In this context, it can be used interchangeably with jerk, and can also be used as a verb to describe rude or deceitful actions. Variants include dickhead, which literally refers to the glans. The offensiveness of the word dick is complicated by the continued use of the word in inoffensive contexts, including as both a given name (often a nickname for Richard) and a surname, the popular British dessert spotted dick,[3] the novel Moby-Dick, the Dick and Jane series of children\u0027s books,[4] and the American retailer Dick\u0027s Sporting Goods.[5] Uses such as these have provided a basis for comedy writers to exploit this juxtaposition through double entendre.[citation needed] Origin and evolution of the pejorative slang In the mid-17th century, dick became slang for a man as a sexual partner.[6] For example, in the 1665 satire The English Rogue by Richard Head, a \"dick\" procured to impregnate a character that is having difficulty conceiving: The next Dick I pickt up for her was a man of a colour as contrary to the former, as light is to darkness, being swarthy; whose hair was as black as a sloe; middle statur\u0027d, well set, both strong and active, a man so universally tryed, and so fruitfully successful, that there was hardly any female within ten miles gotten with child in hugger-mugger, but he was more than suspected to be Father of all the legitimate. Yet this too, proved an ineffectual Operator.[7] An 1869 slang dictionary offered definitions of dick including \"a riding whip\" and an abbreviation of \"dictionary\", also noting that in the North Country, it was used as a verb to indicate that a policeman was eyeing the subject.[8] The term came to be associated with the penis through usage by men in the military around the 1880s.[2] The usage of dick to refer to a contemptible or despicable person was first attested in the 1960s.[9][6][10] Offensiveness \"Dick\", when used in many of its slang connotations, is generally considered at least mildly offensive.[citation needed] In 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts upheld a school policy under which a student was prohibited from wearing a T-shirt with a double entendre, reading \"See Dick Drink. See Dick Drive. See Dick Die. Don’t be a Dick.\"[11] The court in this case held that a legitimate goal of the school—to calm a sexually charged environment and enhance the ability of students to learn—made it unlikely that this restriction was a violation of any First Amendment rights.[12] This decision was vacated the following year by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which noted that students have the right to express their views, and that the T-shirt, \"though reasonably thought vulgar\", did express a view.[13] In 2001, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) published guidelines that summarized instances in which a number of media outlets had violated indecency laws when using the word \"dick\" in a sexual context. These included, for example, the State University of New York\u0027s WSUC-FM, in Cortland, New York, which in 1993 was fined for broadcasting a rap titled \"I\u0027m Not Your Puppet\", which referenced \"shoving my dick up this bitch\u0027s behind\" in one lyric, and stated in another, \"I pulled out my dick, popped it in her mouth, and she sucked it.\"[14] In the same report, however, the FCC noted that in 1990, it had ruled that WFBQ (FM)/WNDE (AM) in Indianapolis had not engaged in indecency when it broadcast the line \"So you talk to Dick Nixon, man you get him on the phone and Dick suggests maybe getting like a mega-Dick to help out, but you know, you remember the time the king ate mega-Dick under the table at a 095 picnic\", and a parody commercial referencing a fictional monster truck called \"Big Peter! Formerly the Big Dick\u0027s Dog Wiener Mobile\".[14] In January 2005, the FCC released a ruling that it would not fine broadcasters whose programs used \"dick\" on the air to refer to a person behaving contemptibly.[15] Specifically, the FCC stated in its ruling: A number of complaints cite isolated uses of the word \"dick\" or variations thereof. In context and as used in the complained of broadcasts, these were epithets intended to denigrate or criticize their subjects. Their use in this context was not sufficiently explicit or graphic and/or sustained to be patently offensive.[16] The name of t",

Sage Publishing has offices located across North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. In North America, Sage Publishing has offices in Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Toronto. The European operations are headquartered in London, United Kingdom. In the Asia Pacific region, Sage Publishing has established offices in Melbourne, Australia, India and Singapore. It publishes more than 1,000 journals, more than 800 books a year,[1] reference works and electronic products covering business, humanities, social sciences, science, technology and medicine. SAGE also owns and publishes under the imprints of Corwin Press[2] (since 1990), CQ Press[3] (since 2008), Learning Matters[4] (since 2011), and Adam Matthew Digital (since 2012).[5] History [edit] World headquarters, Newbury Park neighborhood of Thousand Oaks, California SAGE was founded in 1965 in New York City by Sara Miller (later Sara Miller McCune)[6] with Macmillan Inc. executive George D. McCune as a mentor;[7] the name of the company is an acronym formed from the first letters of their given names.[7] SAGE relocated to Southern California in 1966, after Miller and McCune married; McCune left Macmillan to formally join the company at that time.[7] Sara Miller McCune remained president for 18 years, shifting to board chairmen in 1984 (and still retains the title of executive chairman). The couple continued to develop the company together until George McCune\u0027s death in 1990.[8] In 2008, SAGE along with two other companies, sued Georgia State University for alleged copyright infringement due to faculty providing excerpts of materials to students.[9] The case concluded in 2020 with the publishing companies losing.[9] In 2018, SAGE reported a mean 2017 gender pay gap of 13.1% for its UK workforce, while the median was 10.3%.[10] In 2018, SAGE acquired Lean Library, a browser extension and discovery service,[11] which then faced opposition by part of the academic community for being owned by a for-profit, as opposed to open data, open source and non-profit products like Unpaywall which facilitates usage of open access works.[12] OASPA membership [edit] SAGE Publishing was a founding member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) when it was established in 2008.[13] In November 2013, OASPA reviewed SAGE\u0027s membership after the Journal of International Medical Research accepted a false and intentionally flawed paper created and submitted by a reporter for the journal Science as part of a \"sting\" to test the effectiveness of the peer-review processes of open access journals (see Who\u0027s Afraid of Peer Review?).[14] SAGE\u0027s membership was reinstated at the end of the six month review period following changes to the journal\u0027s editorial processes.[15] Lawsuits [edit] In September 2024, Lucina Uddin, a neuroscience professor at UCLA, sued Sage Publishing along with five other academic journal publishers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, alleging that the publishers violated antitrust law by agreeing not to compete against each other for manuscripts and by denying scholars payment for peer review services.[16][17] Fraud [edit] An academic fraud that impacted journals published by Sage Publishing, particularly the Journal of Vibration and Control (JVC), was uncovered in July 2014 following a 14-month internal investigation by Sage, which revealed a fake peer-review scam involving hundreds of fraudulent and assumed identities.[18][19] The scam was orchestrated mainly by Peter Chen, a physicist at the National Pingtung University of Education (NPUE) in Taiwan. Chen used fake identities and Gmail accounts to pose as university-based scientists, manipulating the peer-review process to ensure favorable reviews for submissions. The scam involved creating a network of papers where the same small group of authors reviewed each other\u0027s work and appeared together as co-authors. This practice, known as a \"peer review ring,\" allowed Chen to publish numerous articles with minimal scrutiny. The lack of vetting and the lax editorial policy at J",

While scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.[1][2][3] However, evidence is weak for hypotheses that the postnatal social environment impacts sexual orientation, especially for males.[3] Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are favored by scientists.[1] These factors, which may be related to the development of a sexual orientation, include genes, the early uterine environment (such as prenatal hormones), and brain structure. While the evolutionary explanation for heterosexuality in organisms that reproduce sexually is straightforwardly understood to be a psychological adaptation resulting from greater reproductive success,[4] evolutionary explanations for homosexuality rely upon other mechanisms of evolution such as kin selection and inc",

A Daddy in gay culture is a slang term meaning a man sexually involved in a relationship with a younger male.[1][2][3] In an internet meme context, Know Your Meme defines the term as a \"slang term of affection used to address a male authority figure or idol in a sexualized manner.\"[4] In BDSM, a \"daddy/boy\" relationship can share similarities with a dynamic of dominance and submission.[5] History [edit] Predecessors [edit] According to the Historical Dictionary of American Slang, the earliest use of \"daddy\" in a non-paternal context was in 1681, in reference to what sex workers called their procurers or older male customers.[6][7] Throughout the 1920s, the term was used in blues music and African-American Vernacular English to mean one\u0027s boyfriend, especially an older man or a sugar daddy. In 1920, the term is used in a romantic context in Aileen Stanley\u0027s blues song \"I Wonder Where My Sweet, Sweet Daddy\u0027s Gone.\"[8] Its usage is similar in Lavinia Turner\u0027s 1922 song \"How Can I Be Your \u0027Sweet Mama\u0027 When You\u0027re \u0027Daddy\u0027 to Someone Else?\"[6][9] The same year, the term appears in Trixie Smith\u0027s \"My Man Rocks Me\" in the lyrics \"My man rocks me, with one steady roll [...] I said now, Daddy, ain’t we got fun\".[10][7] A shirt reading \"I Love Daddy Bears\", pictured at the Oslo pride parade, 2015 In gay culture [edit] New York claimed in 2017 that the gay term evolved from leather subculture, which began in the 1940s.[11] In the 1970s, the \"leather daddy\" archetype (which has sadomasochistic associations) was proliferated in such media as the Drummer magazine (launched in 1975); 1976 to 1979 gay pornographic films Working Man Trilogy; and BDSM novels by Larry Townsend.[12][11] Braidon Schaufert has claimed that the term was further normalized through to Game Grumps\u0027 2017 visual novel game, Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, which centered \"queer fathers in a romance game\" and gained a significant online fandom.[13] The term has increasingly been applied to heterosexual relationships.[citation needed] Gender [edit] In 2000, Andrew Schopp claimed that the Daddy archetype \"challenge[s] dominant ideologies of masculinity by appropriating the icons of masculinity and male authority (jocks, leather, motorcycles, uniforms) and transporting them into the realm of gay male sexual experience.\"[14] In 2018, Braidon Schaufert claimed that, by creating the \u0027daddy\u0027 term, \"Queer communities have separated the specific gender performance of fatherhood from the actual act of raising children\".[13] In the context of T4T relationships (specifically, trans men dating trans men), a Daddy/boy dynamic can be part of the gender affirmation process, thereby leading to gender euphoria. In 2022, Transgender Studies Quarterly claimed that a Daddy/boy dynamic between trans people \"can be read as gender labor; affective and intersubjective work that produces gender\".[15][16] See also [edit] LGBT portal Sexuality portal Sugar dating, a transactional relationship, which may involve use of the term \"sugar daddy\" References [edit] ^ Kirkland, Justin (2018-06-15). \"Here\u0027s an Outrageously Comprehensive Guide to the Term \u0027Daddy\u0027\".

It may be an old custom but has a contemporary identity influenced by other Polynesians, through cross-cultural interaction of Polynesians living in New Zealand, especially the Samoan fa\u0027afafine, Third Gender people who hold a special place in Samoan society.[1] Terms and etymology [edit] According to the Cook Islands Maori dictionary (1995) \u0027akava\u0027ine is the prefix aka (\"to be or to behave like\") and va\u0027ine (\"woman\"),[2] or simply, \"to behave as a woman\". (Antonym: \u0027akatāne (\"act manly, or tomboyishly\").[2][3]) The New Zealand Māori word Whakawahine has a parallel meaning, and the Samoan word fa\u0027afafine and the Malagasy word sarambavy. According to Alexeyeff, Akava\u0027ine is a Cook Islands Māori word for women who have an inflated opinion of themselves, draw attention to themselves in ways that disrupt groupness, do not heed others\u0027 advice, or who act in a self-serving or self-promoting way.[4] Sometimes the word laelae is also used typically when implying criticism or ridicule of feminine behaviour displayed by a man, for example being described as effeminate or homosexual.[4] Laelae is the colloquial Cook Islands term, it is similar to raerae used in Tahiti. The word tutuva\u0027ine (meaning \"like a woman\") is used less frequently and normally refers to a cross-dresser or a drag queen.[4][5] Homosexuality is illegal for males in the Cook Islands,[6] but there is a transgender movement in the Pacific Islands to decriminalize LGBT rights.[7] History [edit] Pacific Islanders have a long history of integration, positions of authority, respect and acceptance towards gender-variant individuals.[citation needed] After the arrival of ",

Find sources: \"Neuroqueer theory\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (March 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) It has been suggested that this article be split out into articles titled Neuroqueer theory and Neurodivergence and LGBTQ identities. (Discuss) (November 2025) Neuroqueer theory is a framework that intersects the fields of neurodiversity and queer theory.[1] It examines the ways society constructs and defines normalcy, particularly concerning gender, sexual orientation, and dis/ability, and challenges those constructions.[2] It critiques the pathologization of neurodivergent individuals and the ways in which it intersects with the marginalization of queer individuals.[2] Neuroqueer theory is reliant on a deep understanding of intersectionality, the way in which people\u0027s social, cultural, and political identities combine and result in unique combinations of privilege and discrimination.[3] The term neuroqueer can be used as a verb, adjective, or identity label. As a verb, it refers to the act of challenging neuronormativity and heteronormativity, as well as advocating for recognition and celebration diverse experiences and identities.[4] As an adjective, neuroqueer describes phenomena, theories, or identities that challenge neuronormativity and heteronormativity, emphasizing the intersections and diversity of queer and neurodivergent identities and experiences.[4] Individuals who identify as neuroqueer are often neurodivergent and queer, though this is not a necessity.[2] Nick Walker, who initially coined the term, has indicated that neurotypical, cisgender, heterosexual individuals may also identify as neuroqueer if they are actively challenging neuronormativity and heteronormativity,[2] especially if they are challenging the existing categorizations of gender, dis/ability label, or sexual orientation.[4][5] Recent studies have suggested the existence of a relationship between queerness and neurodivergence: where neurodivergent people are more likely than their neurotypical peers to identify as LGBTQIA+, and gender diverse people are more likely to be neurodivergent than their cisgender peers.[6][7][8][9][10] At the present time, the reason for the connection between queerness and neurodivergence is not known, though several hypotheses exist, they each require further investigation.[6][10][11] Definition [edit] Neuroqueer was initially conceptualized as a verb—neuroqueering—as a way of \"queering [...] neurocognitive norms as well as gender norms\".[2] Walker has indicated that, as a verb, neuroqueer \"refers to a broad range of interrelated practices\", and \"as an adjective, it describes things that are associated with those practices or that result from those practices\".[2] Nick Walker, Athena Lynn Michaels-Dillon, and Remi Yergeau established the following eight integral components:[2] As an adjective, neuroqueer can refer to people who are \"both neurodivergent and queer, with some degree of conscious awareness and/or active exploration around how these two aspects of one\u0027s being entwine and interact\".[2] As an adjective, neuroqueer means \"embodying and expressing one\u0027s neurodivergence in ways that also queer one\u0027s performance of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and/or other aspects of one\u0027s identity\".[2] As a verb, neuroqueer means \"engaging in practices intended to undo and subvert one\u0027s own cultural conditioning and one\u0027s ingrained habits of neuronormative and heteronormative performance, with the aim of reclaiming one\u0027s capacity to give more full expression to one\u0027s uniquely weird potentials and inclinations\".[2] As a verb, neuroqueer means \"engaging in the queering of one\u0027s own neurocognitive processes (and one\u0027s outward embodiment and expression of those processes) by intentionally altering them in ways that create significant and lasting increase in one\u0027s divergence from prevailing cultural standards of neuronormativity and heteronormativity\".[2] As a verb, neuroqueer means \"approaching, embodying, and/or experiencing one\u0027s neurodivergence as a form of queerness\".[2] As a verb, neuroqueer means \"producing literature, art, scholarship, and/or other cultural artifacts that foreground neuroqueer experiences, perspectives, and voices\".[2] As a verb, neuroqueer means \"producing critical responses to literature and/or other cultural artifacts, focusing on intentional or unintentional characterizations of neuroqueerness and how those characterizations illuminate and/or are illuminated by actual neuroqueer lives and experiences\".[2] As a verb, neuroqueer means \"working to transform social and cultural environments in order to create spaces and communities— and ultimately a society— in which e",

Femboy can be used as both a sexual and non-sexual term; it does not denote a specific sexual orientation or gender role. The term originated in the 1990s. It has since been popularised through internet forums and social media, starting on 4chan and expanding to other sites such as Reddit and TikTok, where hashtag trends such as \"#femboyfriday\" have received attention in the media. In gender studies, the term has also been used as an identifier for individuals on the transgender spectrum; in porn studies, the term has been seen as an identifier for a submissive role in intercourse and as exhibiting elements of sexual fantasy. Usage Etymology According to Dictionary.com, the term femboy originated at least in the 1990s. It is a compound noun from the words fem (an abbreviation of feminine and femme) and boy.[1][2] However, one early usage can be found in the 1981 release of the Abbreviations Dictionary by editor and photographer Ralph De Sola.[3] The variant femboi uses the LGBTQ term boi.[1] By 2000, the term boi[4] had come to denote \"a young, attractive gay man\". The term \"boi\" has also been used, independently of any meaning related to sexuality, as an alternate spelling for boy.[5] Definitions Collins English Dictionary defines femboy as \"a male whose appearance and behavioural traits are regarded as conventionally feminine\".[6] According to Dictionary.com, t",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For the phrase sometimes relatedly used, see Same-sex. Two men at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear indicate their identity with the word gay. Terms used to describe homosexuality have gone through many changes since the emergence of the first terms in the mid-19th century. In English, some terms in widespread use have been sodomite, Sapphic, Uranian or Urning, homophile, lesbian, gay, and queer. Some of these words are specific to women, some to men, and some can be used of either. Gay people may also be identified under the umbrella term LGBT. Homosexual was coined in German in 1868.[1] Academia continues to coin related terms, including androphilia and gynephilia which designate only the object of attraction, thus divorcing the terms from sexual orientation entirely. Numerous slang terms exist for homosexuals or homosexuality. Some communities have cants, a rich jargon used among a subgroup almost like a secret language, such as Polari in the UK, and others. Prescribed usage [edit] The term homosexual can be used as an adjective to describe the sexual attractions and behaviors of people attracted to the same sex. Author and gay pioneer Quentin Crisp said that the term should be \"homosexualist\", adding that no one says \"I am a sexual\".[2] Some gay people argue that the use of homosexual as a noun is offensive, arguing that they are people first and their homosexuality is merely an attribute of their humanity. Even if they do not consider the term offensive, some people in same-gender relationships may object to being described as homosexual because they identify as bisexual+, or another orientation such as (rarely) \"unstraight\".[3] Some style guides recommend that the terms homosexual and homosexuality be avoided altogether, lest their use cause confusion or arouse controversy. In particular, the description of individuals as homosexual may be offensive, partially because of the negative clinical association of the word stemming from its use in describing same-gender attraction as a pathological state before homosexuality was removed from the American Psychiatric Association\u0027s list of mental disorders in 1973.[4] The Associated Press and The New York Times style guides restrict usage of the terms.[5] Same-gender oriented people seldom apply such terms to themselves, and public officials and agencies often avoid them. For instance, the Safe Schools Coalition of Washington\u0027s Glossary for School Employees advises that gay is the \"preferred synonym for homosexual\",[6] and goes on to suggest avoiding the term homosexual as it is \"clinical, distancing, and archaic\". However, the terms homosexual and homosexuality are sometimes deemed appropriate in referring to behavior (although same-gender is the preferred adjective). Using homosexuality or homosexual to refer to behavior may be inaccurate but does not carry the same potentially offensive connotations that using homosexual to describe a person does. When referring to people, homosexual might be considered derogatory and the terms gay and lesbian are preferred. Some have argued that homosexual places emphasis on sexuality over humanity, and is to be avoided when describing a person. Gay man or lesbian are the preferred nouns for referring to people, which stress cultural and social matters over sex.[6] The New Oxford American Dictionary[7] says that gay is the preferred term. People with a same-gender sexual orientation generally prefer the terms gay, lesbian, or bisexual. The most common terms are gay (both men and women) and lesbian (women only). Other terms include same gender loving and same-sex-oriented.[4] Among some sectors of gay sub-culture, same-gender sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure instead of romantic attraction. Men on the down-low (or DL) may engage in covert sexual activity with other men while pursuing sexual and romantic relationships with women. History [edit] The choice of terms regarding sexual orientation may imply a certain political outlook, and different terms have been preferred at different times and in different places. Early history [edit] Historian and philosopher Michel Foucault argued that homosexual and heterosexual identities did not emerge until the 19th century. Prior to that time, he said, the terms described practices and not identity. Foucault cited Karl Westphal\u0027s famous 1870 article Contrary Sexual Feeling as the \"date of birth\" of the categorization of sexual orientation.[8] Some scholars, however, have argued that there are significant continuities between past and present conceptualizations of sexuality, with various terms having been used for homosexuality.[9][10] In his Symposium, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato described (through the character of the profane comedian Aristophanes) three sexual orientations – heterosexuality, male homosexuality, and female homosexuality – and provided explanations for their existence ",

Find sources: \"Sex assignment\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (June 2023) Sex assignment (also known as gender assignment[a][1][2]) is the discernment of an infant\u0027s sex, typically made at birth based on an examination of the newborn\u0027s external genitalia by a healthcare provider such as a midwife, nurse, or physician.[3] In the vast majority of cases (99.95%), sex is assigned unambiguously at birth. However, in about 1 in 2000 births, the baby\u0027s genitals may not clearly indicate male or female, necessitating additional diagnostic steps, and deferring sex assignment.[4][5] In most countries the healthcare provider\u0027s determination, along with other details of the birth, is by law recorded on an official document and submitted to the government for later issuance of a birth certificate and for other legal purposes.[6] The prevalence of intersex conditions, where a baby\u0027s sex characteristics do not conform strictly to typical definitions of male or female, ranges between 0.018% and 1.7%.[7][8][9] While some intersex conditions result in genital ambiguity (approximately 0.02% to 0.05% of births[4]), others present genitalia that are distinctly male or female, which may delay the recognition of an intersex condition until later in life.[10][11] When assigning sex to intersex individuals, some healthcare providers may consider the gender identity that most people with a similar intersex condition develop, although such assignments may be revised as the individual matures.[2][12] The use of surgical or hormonal interventions to reinforce sex assignments in intersex individuals without informed consent is considered a violation of human rights, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.[13][2][14][15] Societally and medically, it is generally assumed that a person\u0027s gender identity will align with the sex assigned at birth, making them cisgender. However, for a minority, assigned sex and gender identity do not coincide, leading to transgender identity experiences. Terminology Sex assignment refers to the identification of an infant\u0027s sex at birth, typically based on observable physical characteristics. This is also known as gender assignment.[2][16] In clinical and medical contexts, terms such as \"birth-assigned sex\" or \"birth-assigned gender\" are used to describe the sex identified at birth, or sex assigned at birth, or SAAB, while \"assigned sex\" and \"assigned gender\" may also refer to any subsequent reassignments, especially common among intersex individuals. The terminology has evolved across various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) maintained by the American Psychiatric Association. Initially, the third edition of the DSM referred to \"anatomic sex\".[17] By the fourth edition in 1994, the term \"assigned sex\" was introduced, with subsequent editions also using \"biological sex\" and \"natal gender\". The latest revision in 2022 streamlined the language to consistently use \"sex assignment\".[18][2][19] A 2006 consensus statement on intersex conditions also adopted the terms \"assigned sex\" and \"assigned gender\". Sex is assigned as either male or female, leading to specific terms:[12][2][20] Assigned female at birth A person of any age and irrespective of current gender whose sex was assigned as female at birth. Often shortened to AFAB. Synonyms include female assigned at birth (FAAB) and designated female at birth (DFAB).[21][22] Assigned male at birth A person of any age and irrespective of current gender whose sex was assigned as male at birth. Often shortened to AMAB. Synonyms include male assigned at birth (MAAB) and designated male at birth (DMAB).[21][22] Assigned gender at birth Assigned gender at birth. Sometimes shortened to AGAB.[23] More visible adoption of the terminology of sex assignment has led to public debate and criticism.[24] There is a consensus in the use of the term \"sex assignment\" for newborns with intersex conditions;[20] observed chromosomal sex and assigned sex may intentionally differ for medical reasons (based upon predictions of psychosocial and psychosexual health in later life).[25] Assignment in cases of infants with intersex traits, or cases of trauma Main articles: Intersex medical interventions and History of intersex surgery Intersex topics Human rights and legal issues Compulsory sterilization Discrimination Human rights reports Legal recognition Malta declaration ",

In academia and media [edit] Queer historian Gregory Samantha Rosenthal refers to queer erasure in describing the exclusion of LGBTQ history from public history that can occur in urban contexts via gentrification.[3] Rosenthal says this results in the \"displacement of queer peoples from public view\".[4] Cáel Keegan describes the lack of appropriate and realistic representation of queer people, HIV-positive people, and queer people of color as being a type of aesthetic gentrification, where space is being appropriated from queer people\u0027s communities where queer people are not given any cultural representation.[5] Erasure of LGBTQ people has taken place in medical research and schools as well, such as in the case of AIDS research that does not include lesbian populations.[citation needed] Medicine and academia can be places where visibility is produced or erased, such as the exclusion of gay and bisexual women in HIV discourses and studies or the lack of attention to LGBTQ identities in dealing with anti-bullying discourse in schools.[citation needed] Straightwashing [edit] Main article: Straightwashing Straightwashing is a form of queer erasure that refers to the portrayal of LGBTQ people, fictional characters, or historical figures as heterosexual.[6] It is most prominently seen in works of fiction, whereby characters who were originally portrayed as or inten",

This metaphor is associated and sometimes combined with coming out, the act of revealing one\u0027s sexuality or gender to others, to create the phrase \"coming out of the closet\". Some reasons why LGBTQ people stay closeted include discrimination, fear for one\u0027s safety, internalized homophobia or transphobia or living in a hostile environment.[1] Etymology [edit] Nondisclosure of one\u0027s sexual orientation or gender identity preceded the use of \"closet\" as a term for the act. For example, the writer Thomas Mann entered a heterosexual marriage with a woman in 1905, and had six children, but discussed his attraction to men in his private diary, which by contemporary terms would have designated him a closeted homosexual man. D. Travers Scott claims that the phrase \"coming out of the closet\", along with its derivative meanings of \"coming out\" and \"closeted\", has its origins in two different metaphors. \"Coming out\" was first a phrase used in the early 20th century in reference to a young woman attending a debutante ball, such that she was \"coming out\" into society. In past times, the word \"closet\" meant \"bedroom\", so one\u0027s sexuality was not shown beyond there. Later in the 1960s, the metaphor of a \"skeleton in the closet\", which meant to hide a secret due to taboos or social stigmas, was also used in reference to a gender identity or sexuality that one may not wish to disclos",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Slogan associated with white supremacy A sticker with the slogan publicly displayed in 2017 \"It\u0027s okay to be white\" (IOTBW) is an alt-right slogan which originated as part of an organized trolling campaign on the website 4chan\u0027s discussion board /pol/ in 2017.[1][2][3] A /pol/ user described it as a proof of concept that an otherwise innocuous message could be used maliciously to spark media backlash.[4][5] Posters and stickers stating \"It\u0027s okay to be white\" were placed in streets in the United States as well as on campuses in the United States, Canada, Australia,[6] and the United Kingdom.[7][5] The slogan has been supported by white supremacists and neo-Nazis.[2][1][8] Media coverage of the event, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson asking \"What\u0027s the correct position? That it\u0027s not okay to be white?\", was seen as reacting in the way that the trolling campaign had intended.[8] Background The suggestion for the use of posters with the saying originated on the message board /pol/ of 4chan, with the intent of provoking reactions. The saying was later spread by neo-Nazi groups and politically organized white supremacists, including former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke and The Daily Stormer.[8] A report by the Anti-Defamation League states that the phrase itself has a history within the white supremacist movement going back to 2001 when it was used as the title of a song by a white power music group called Aggressive Force as well as fliers with the phrase being spotted in 2005 and the slogan being used by a member of the United Klans of America.[7] Reactions Discarded \"It\u0027s okay to be white\" cards after a Patriot Prayer protest in Portland, Oregon Many of the flyers were torn down, and some accused the posters of being covertly racist[8][9] and white nationalist,[10] while others, like Jeff Guillory, executive director of Washington State University\u0027s Office of Equity and Diversity, argued that it was a nonthreatening statement.[11] Academia The University of Regina declared the posters divisive.[12][13] University President Vianne Timmons said: \"Simply put, these signs have no place at our university.\"[14] A spokesman for a Waterloo Region District School Board commented: \"Our schools are safe spaces. We want to see them be safe for all of our children, so to see this kind of thing emerge is a worry.\"[15] After the signs were found at Washington State University, Phil Weiler, Vice President of University Communications, said: \"one could reasonably believe the intention of the signs is to set a sense of fear and intimidation on campus\".[16] Executive director of Washington State University\u0027s Office of Equity and Diversity responded to the posters by saying: \"In my mind, it\u0027s a nonthreatening statement\", further stating: \"Sure, it\u0027s OK to be white. It\u0027s OK to be African-American. It\u0027s OK to be Latino. It\u0027s OK to be gay.\"[11] The University of Utah said: \"If, indeed, these tactics are meant to silence our work in diversity and inclusion, please know we shall not be deterred.\"[17] Concordia College said that their president was planning a meeting where students could discuss the matter.[18] Police were contacted regarding the flyers being posted at the University of California, Berkeley. A police department spokesperson said \"the signs did not constitute a hate crime because they did not target a specific race and because no criminal act was committed\".[19][20] In November 2017, Lucian Wintrich attempted to give a speech titled \"It\u0027s OK to be White\" at the University of Connecticut as an invited speaker of the school\u0027s Republican club.[21][22] The speech was protested and came to an end when a protester, employed as the director of career services at Quinebaug Valley Community College,[23] grabbed Wintrich\u0027s speech papers from the podium and Wintrich grabbed her, resulting in breach of peace charges against Wintrich.[24][25] In December 2017, the charges against Wintrich were dropped, and the woman who took the papers was charged with attempted sixth-degree larceny and disorderly conduct. She stated through her attorney she took Wintrich\u0027s speech as a form of protest, describing Wintrich\u0027s \"It\u0027s OK to be White\" speech as hateful language.[26][23] Media Some media sources reacted in the way the original authors on 4chan had expected.[27] Tucker Carlson on Fox News defended the campaign in a segment entitled \"High school Fliers Create Shock and Horror\". Carlson asked: \"What\u0027s the correct position? That it\u0027s not okay to be white?\"[28] Newsweek writer Michael Hayden said Carlson was helping to spread neo-Nazi propaganda by defending the posters, saying the slogan is being \"promoted by neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\"[8] Writing for The Washington Post, Janell Ross commented on the poster campaign, saying \"the white victim construct is one that experts say, not so long ago, only had traction in avowed white supremacists, segregationists, and neo-Nazi ",

The first publication by the Institute was the Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere e Arti (lit. \u0027Italian Encyclopaedia of Science, Letters, and Arts\u0027), which was completed in 1939, and consisted of 36 volumes.[5] Best known as Enciclopedia Italiana or the Great Encyclopaedia, it is an Italian-language encyclopaedia and is regarded as one of the great encyclopaedias, being international in scope, alongside Encyclopædia Britannica and others.[6] Since the 1990s, Treccani has been playing a leading role as a high-profile publisher, both in the art publishing market and in the facsimile editions industry, reproducing many medieval manuscripts from the most prestigious Italian and European libraries. Alongside these traditional activities Treccani has gained a consistent presence in digital publishing, with the publication of e-books, apps and, above all, the Treccani.it portal, which had been visited in 2022 by more than 80 million unique users. Publishing and works [edit] The first edition of the Great Encyclopaedia was published serially between 1929 and 1937.[2][7] The encyclopaedia\u0027s 35 volumes (plus one index volume) included 60,000 articles and 50 million words.[8] Each volume is approximately 1,015 pages, and supplementary volumes were published between 1938 and 2020. 10th Appendix [edit] An update to the Great Encyclopaedia, the 10th Appendix is a reflection by Treccani on contemporaneity. Its challenges and problematic issues are analyzed through over 350 keywords assigned to authors of the highest scientific profile and to young scholars who have now established themselves at the international level.[2][9] Biographical Dictionary of the Italians [edit] Main article: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani This work is a monumental national biography constructed from over forty thousand biographies of ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia People of dual male and female spirit in traditional Hawaiian and Tahitian cultures For the ancient Egyptian noble, see Mahu (noble). For the Dahomey goddess, see Mawu. Māhū in Native Hawaiian and Tahitian cultures are people who embody both male and female spirit.[1][2] They have traditional spiritual and social roles within the culture, similar to Tongan fakaleiti and Samoan fa\u0027afafine.[3] The terms “third gender” and “in the middle” have been used to help explain māhū in the English language. According to present-day māhū kumu hula Kaua\u0027i Iki:[4] Māhū were particularly respected as teachers, usually of hula dance and chant. In pre-contact times māhū performed the roles of goddesses in hula dances that took place in temples which were off-limits to women. Māhū were also valued as the keepers of cultural traditions, such as the passing down of genealogies. Traditionally parents would ask māhū to name their children. Historically, māhū was a respectful term for people assigned male at birth, but with colonization the word was denigrated and used as an insult to refer to homosexuals. More recently, there has been an effort to recapture the original dignity and respect accorded the term māhū.[5] History [edit] Papa Moe (Mysterious Water), an oil painting by the Westerner, Paul Gauguin, from 1893. It depicts a māhū in Tahiti drinking from a waterfall.[6][7] In the pre-colonial history of Hawai\u0027i, māhū were notable healers, although much of this history was elided through the intervention of Christian missionaries.[8] According to Joan Roughgarden, the māhū lacked access to political power, were unable to aspire to leadership roles, and \"Perceived as always available for sexual conquest by men.\"[9][page needed] The first published description of māhū occurs in Captain William Bligh\u0027s logbook of the Bounty, which stopped in Tahiti in 1789, where he was introduced to a member of a \"class of people very common in Otaheitie called Mahoo... who although I was certain was a man, had great marks of effeminacy about him.\"[10] A surviving monument to this history are the Healer Stones of Kapaemāhū on Waikiki Beach, which commemorate four important māhū who first brought the healing arts from Tahiti to Hawaiʻi.[11][12] These are referred to by Hawaiian historian Mary Kawena Pukui as pae māhū, or literally a row of māhū.[13] The term māhū is misleadingly defined in Pukui and Ebert\u0027s Hawaiian dictionary as \"n. Homosexual, of either sex; hermaphrodite.\"[14] The assumption of same-sex behavior reflects the conflation of gender and sexuality that was common at that time.[note 1] The idea that māhū are biological mosaics appears to be a misunderstanding of the term hermaphrodite, which in early publications by sexologists and anthropologists was used generally to mean \"an individual which has the attributes of both male and female;\" this led to homosexual, bisexual, and gender nonconforming individuals being mislabeled as \"hermaphrodites\" in the medical literature.[15] The history of Kapaemahu was revived through an animated film, picture book, and museum exhibition. In 1891, when painter Paul Gauguin first came to Tahiti, he was thought to be a māhū by the indigenous people, due to his flamboyant manner of dress during that time.[16] His 1893 painting Papa Moe (Mysterious Water) depicts a māhū drinking from a small waterfall.[16][7] Missionaries to Hawai\u0027i introduced biblical laws to the islands in the 1820s; under their influence Hawai\u0027i\u0027s first anti-sodomy law was passed in 1850. These laws led to the social stigmatization of the māhū in Hawai\u0027i. Beginning in the mid-1960s the Honolulu City Council required trans women to wear a badge identifying themselves as male.[17] In American artist George Biddle\u0027s Tahitian Journal (1920–1922) he writes about several māhū friends in Tahiti, of their role in native Tahitian society, and of the persecution of a māhū friend Naipu, who fled Tahiti due to colonial French laws that sent māhū and homosexuals to hard labor in prison in New Caledonia.[18] Rae rae is a social category of māhū that came into use in Tahiti in the 1960s, although it is criticized by some māhū as an abject reference to sex. In contemporary cultures [edit] In the 1980s, māhū and fa\u0027afafine of Samoa began organizing, as māhū. In 2021, a group of Kānaka Maoli formed a subgroup of the Hawaiʻi LGBT Legacy Foundation called the māhūi that developed a ceremony to open Honolulu Pride month at the Kapaemahu monument in Waikīkī, now repeated every October. In 2003,[19] the term mahuwahine was coined within Hawaii\u0027s queer community: māhū (in the middle) + wahine (woman), the structure of the word is similar to Samoan fa\u0027a (the way of) + fafine (woman/wife). The term mahuwahine resembles a transgender identity that coincides with Hawaiian cultural renaissance.[20] The corresponding term for biological females is mahukane (māhū + kane (man)). However, in contemporary usage, ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Woman and Her Maid by Giovanni Antonio da Brescia, 1500. Statue of two ancient Egyptian women, Idet and Ruiu, depicted in a form typical of married couples, Museo Egizio.[1] Lesbianism is sexual and romantic desire or relationships between women. Women have typically been underrepresented in history as both writers and subjects, and lesbianism has been correspondingly under-recorded. Since the 1970s, efforts have been made to gather together and preserve lesbian history.[2][3] Antiquity [edit] Ancient Mesopotamia [edit] Women\u0027s sexuality in ancient Mesopotamia is not well documented. Stephanie Lynn Budin, writing on love magic, argues that \"there remains no evidence for lesbianism in this regard (or any other from Mesopotamia).\"[4] However, there are at least two pieces of textual evidence for Mesopotamian lesbianism.[5] One is a divinatory text which mentions female same-sex activity,[6] while another, more explicit text remains unpublished.[7] In addition, an Old Assyrian text writes of two women, Ewanika and Adi-matum, who had a betrothal contract for their \"daughter.\" It is possible that the father died, leaving the two women as widows.[8] Ancient Egypt [edit] The Dream Book of the Carlsberg papyrus XIII claims that \"If a woman dreams that a woman has intercourse with her, she will come to a bad end\".[9][10] Depictions of women during the New Kingdom suggest they enjoyed, in a relaxed and intimate atmosphere, the company of other women who were scantily clad or naked. Some cosmetics-related items, which may have been owned and used by women, feature nude and suggestive depictions of women.[10] In the fifth century CE, women at the White Monastery in Upper Egypt sometimes pursued same-sex relationships. A letter from Shenoute chastises two women, ⲧⲁⲏⲥⲉ, Taêse and ⲧⲥⲁⲛⲥⲛⲱ, Tsansnô, for running after each other \"in friendship and physical desire\".[11] This phrase referred to homosexual advances, which were not uncommon.[12] It is unknown if the corporal punishment Shenoute prescribed for the women was administered.[13] Early imperial China [edit] In early Chinese history sexual activity between women was accepted, and sometimes actively encouraged.[14][15] Female same-sex relationships were described with a special term (traditional Chinese: 對食; simplified Chinese: 对食; pinyin: duìshí), literally \u0027paired eating\u0027, possibly referring to cunnilingus. In the second or third century AD Ying Shao defined it as \"when palace women attach themselves as husband and wife\".[16] Such relationships sometimes formed between government slaves or members of the emperor\u0027s harem. For example, under Emperor Cheng\u0027s rule (33–7 BC) the slave Dào Fáng (Chinese: 道房) had a homosexual relationship with Cáo Gōng (traditional Chinese: 曹宮; simplified Chinese: 曹宫), the daughter of a slave.[17] The sex handbook Dongxuanzi (Chinese: 洞玄子; pinyin: Dòng Xuán Zǐ, possibly dating to the fifth century AD[18]) also contains examples of female same-sex contact. In the position called The Paired Dance of the Female Blue Phoenixes, two women practice scissoring.[19] Ancient Greece [edit] Sappho and Influence [edit] The poet Sappho (c. 630 – c. 570 BC)\u0027s poems discuss her love for women, and she is the most often mentioned example of an ancient Greek woman who may have actually engaged in sexual relationships with women. For instance, in Sappho\u0027s Ode to Aphrodite, the poet asks Aphrodite for aid in wooing another woman.[20] One fragment of Sappho\u0027s poetry, Sappho 94, contains a clear mention of lesbian sexual acts:[21] Sappho Fragment 94[22] I\u0027m not pretending; I wish I were dead.” She was leaving me in tears, and over and over she said to me: “Sappho, it hurts; what\u0027s happened to us is just so grim; it isn\u0027t my choice, I swear it, to leave like this.” These were the words that I answered her: “Go and be happy; remember me, for you know how we have paid court to you: and if not, then I want to remind you ... and the good things we have enjoyed: for at my side, many the crowns of violets and roses ... you have put on yourself, and many the garlands woven from flowers you have cast round your delicate neck, and with quantities of ... flowery perfume ... fit for a queen even, you anointed yourself all over, and on soft beds ... delicate ... you have satisfied desire ... Sappho\u0027s sexuality has been debated by historians. Some, such as Denys Page, argue that Sappho was attracted to women. Others, such as Eva Stigers, argue that the descriptions of love between women in Sappho\u0027s writings are not necessarily evidence of her own sexuality.[23] Yet other historians claim that Sappho\u0027s circle were involved in female homosexuality as a kind of initiation ritual.[24] The earliest evidence of Sappho\u0027s reputation for homosexual desire comes from the Hellenistic period, with a fragment of a biography found in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri which criticizes Sappho for being \"gynaikerastria.\"[note 1][25] There are at lea",

For the Japanese girl group, see E-girls. \"E-boy\" redirects here. For the TV series, see E-Boy (TV series). For the pixel art group, see eBoy. For the single, see \"Electric Boy\". An e-girl with typical fashion and makeup. Heavy eyeliner, small symbols applied to the face, and heavy blush are common. E-girls and e-boys, sometimes collectively referred to as e-kids[1][better source needed], are a youth subculture of Gen Z that emerged in the late 2010s,[2] notably popularized by the video-sharing application TikTok.[3] It is an evolution of emo, scene, and mall goth fashion, combined with Japanese and South Korean street fashion.[4][5] Videos by e-girls and e-boys tend to be flirtatious and, many times, overtly sexual.[6][7] Eye-rolling and protruding tongues (a facial expression known as ahegao, imitating climaxing) are common.[8] According to Business Insider, the terms are not gender-specific, instead referring to two separate styles of fashion, stating that \"While the e-boy is a vulnerable \u0027softboi\u0027 and embraces skate culture, the e-girl is cute and seemingly innocent\".[9] Origins [edit] The terms \"e-girl\" and \"e-boy\" are derived from \"electronic boy\" and \"electronic girl\" due to their association with the internet.[10] \"E-girl\" was first used in the late-2000s as a pejorative against women perceived to be seeking out male attention online. According to an article by Business Insider, the earliest examples of e-girls were found on Tumblr,[9] with Vice Media stating the subculture evolved out of the earlier emo and scene cultures.[11] Vox writer Rebecca Jennings instead referred to the Tumblr aesthetic as a precursor of the subculture, as it lacked the cutesy aspect that would come to define e-girl hair and makeup.[12] Ruby Barry of Heatworld traces the origins of e-girl fashion to 2000s Japanese street fashion, including anime, kawaii and lolita fashion styles.[4] Kayla Marci of Edited described it as an evolution of emo, scene and mall goth fashion that was heavily influenced by Asian fashion styles such as anime, cosplay and K-pop.[5] i-D referred to Avril Lavigne as \"the original e-girl\" due to her polished take on alternative fashion, contrast to mainstream norms of the time and affinity for Japanese kawaii culture.[13] Additionally, fictional characters such as Ramona Flowers, Harley Quinn and Sailor Moon were influential on the development of the subculture.[14][15] By the late-2010s, e-boys had split from this original all female culture, embracing elements of emo, mallgoth, and scene culture.[16] The popularity and eventual death of emo rapper Lil Peep also influenced the beginnings of the subculture,[17] with the New York Post describing him as \"the patron musical saint of e-land\".[18] E-boys also make use of \"soft-boy aesthetics\" through presenting themselves as sensitive and vulnerable. According to the Brown Daily Herald this is due to a transformation of ideal male attractiveness from being traditionally masculine to embracing introvertedness, shyness, emotional vulnerability and androgyny.[19] Mainstream popularity [edit] English musician Yungblud is an e-boy. The subculture gained mainstream attention in 2018, following the worldwide release of TikTok. According to an article in i-D, the subculture\u0027s emergence on the app challenged the polished and edited photos of influencers and VSCO girls common on Instagram, due to TikTok lacking the features to do so.[20] An article by CNN stated that \"If VSCO girls are the sunshine-basking hippies of 2020, e-girls are the opposite\".[21] The subculture first began to gain mainstream attention in 2019.[9] MEL Magazine attributed the subculture\u0027s popularity to the increased interest of K-Pop groups like BTS, Exo and Got7 in the Western mainstream, due to the two\u0027s similar style of dress and hair.[22] A trend soon began on TikTok and other social media platforms, where people would upload videos \"transforming\" into an e-boy or e-girl, according to Vox Media, this is how the culture \"entered the mainstream lexicon\".[12][23] In the summer of 2019, Belle Delphine\u0027s emerging online prominence helped bring attention to the e-girl subculture; Business Insider described Delphine as \"a symbol of the first wave of e-girl\".[24] The July 2019 murder of Bianca Devins also brought attention to e-girls due to Devins\u0027 participation in the subculture.[25] The subculture continued to grow in prominence through 2020, with Vogue publishing an article featuring Doja Cat discussing e-girl makeup,[26] and \"e-girl style\" being in the top 10 trending fashion terms on Google in the year.[27] Additionally, a number of mainstream celebrities began to adopt the bleached stripes hairstyle associated with e-girls, including American socialite Kylie Jenner[28] and Kosovar-English singer Dua Lipa.[29] In July, high fashion designer Hedi Slimane released a preview of a ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Flat chest) Part of the female primate torso that has mammary glands For other uses, see Breast (disambiguation). Breast Morphology of female human breasts, with the areola, nipple, and inframammary fold Male human breasts with defined pectoral muscles Details Artery Internal thoracic artery Vein Internal thoracic vein Identifiers Latin mamma (mammalis \u0027of the breast\u0027)[1] MeSH D001940 TA98 A16.0.02.001 TA2 7097 FMA 9601 Anatomical terminology [edit on Wikidata] The breasts are two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso among humans and other primates. Both sexes develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. The relative size and development of the breasts is a major secondary sex distinction between females and males. There is also considerable variation in size between individuals. Permanent breast growth during puberty is caused by estrogens in conjunction with the growth hormone. Female humans are the only mammals that permanently develop breasts at puberty; all other mammals develop their mammary tissue during the latter period of pregnancy. In females, the breast serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants.[2] Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its distinct size and globular shape. At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals.[3] During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, breasts can figure prominently in the perception of a woman\u0027s body and sexual attractiveness. Breasts, especially the nipples, can be an erogenous zone, and part of sexual activity. Some cultures ascribe social and sexual characteristics to female breasts, and may regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. Breasts can represent fertility, femininity, or abundance. Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. Etymology and terminology The English word breast derives from the Old English word brēost \u0027breast, bosom\u0027 from Proto-Germanic *breustam \u0027breast\u0027, from the Proto-Indo-European base *bhreus– \u0027to swell, to sprout\u0027.[4] The breast spelling conforms to the Scottish and North English dialectal pronunciations.[5] The Merriam-Webster Dictionary states that \"Middle English brest, [comes] from Old English brēost; akin to Old High German brust..., Old Irish brú [belly], [and] Russian bryukho\"; the first known usage of the term was before the 12th century.[6] Breasts is often used to refer to female breasts in particular, though the stricter anatomical term refers to the same region on members of either sex. Male breasts are sometimes referred to in the singular to mean the collective upper chest area,[a] whereas female breasts are referred to in the plural unless speaking of a specific left or right breast. A large number of colloquial terms for female breasts are used in English, ranging from fairly polite terms to vulgar or slang.[b] Some vulgar slang expressions may be considered to be derogatory or sexist to women.[7] Evolutionary development Mountain gorilla breastfeeding an infant Humans are the only mammals whose breasts become permanently enlarged after sexual maturity (known in humans as puberty). The reason for this evolutionary change is unknown.[8] Several hypotheses have been put forward: A link has been proposed to processes for synthesizing the endogenous steroid hormone precursor dehydroepiandrosterone which takes place in fat rich regions of the body like the buttocks and breasts. These contributed to human brain development and played a part in increasing brain size. Breast enlargement may for this purpose have occurred as early as Homo ergaster (1.7–1.4 MYA).[9] Other breast formation hypotheses may have then taken over as principal drivers.[10][11][9] It has been suggested by zoologists Avishag and Amotz Zahavi that the size of the human breasts can be explained by the handicap theory of sexual dimorphism. This would see the explanation for larger breasts as them being an honest display of the women\u0027s health and ability to grow and carry them in her life. Prospective mates can then evaluate the genes of a potential mate for their ability to sustain her health even with the additional energy demanding burden she is carrying.[12][13] The zoologist Desmond Morris describes a sociobiological approach in his science book The Naked Ape. He suggests, by making comparisons with the other primates, that breasts evolved to replace swelling buttocks as a sex signal of ovulation. He notes how humans have, relatively",

Terms used include anti-transmasculinity and transandrophobia.[1] The rare term transmisandry is also used, though much less frequently than the equivalent term for prejudice against trans women, transmisogyny.[5] Julia Serano, who coined transmisogyny in 2007,[4] commented in 2021 that \"misogyny may intersect with transphobia in different ways\" for transgender men as opposed to transgender women, which \"doesn\u0027t necessarily make transmisogyny \u0027wrong\u0027; it may simply mean that we need additional language.\"[6] Instances [edit] Lack of visibility [edit] Transgender men historically did not enjoy much visibility due to lack of awareness that female-to-male transition existed. Historian Susan Stryker notes that though Reed Erickson, a wealthy trans man, funded much of the inchoate, \"often-confusing maze\" of medical providers in the United States treating trans people, they tended not to be focused on the needs of trans men in practice. In 1968, Mario Martino founded Labyrinth, the first counselling organization exclusively concerned with the care of trans men, to help other trans men navigate the process of medical and social transition through these providers.[7] Transphobia [edit] Issues of bodily autonomy also affect transgender men. Transgender men who retain their uteruses may be able to become pregnant, but may also face additional barriers to abortion services. In 2018, proposed legislation to legalize abortion in Ir",

Relatively little in history was documented to describe women\u0027s lives in general or female homosexuality in particular. The earliest mentions of lesbianism date to around the 600s-500s BC, including Sappho\u0027s poetry. Lesbian relationships and attractions, along with gender nonconforming behaviors more often displayed by lesbians, have been treated in different ways throughout different ages and cultures. While there is a longer documented history of lesbian behavior and relationships throughout different cultures, the idea of a \u0027lesbian\u0027 as a category of person distinct from other women emerged in Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Lesbians\u0027 current rights vary widely worldwide, ranging from severe abuse and legal persecution to general acceptance and legal protections. Modern polls often estimate lesbians to be 1-3% of the population (i.e., 2-6% of women). Lesbian social movements often advocate for legal changes (such as anti-discrimination protections, child custody protections, and legal civil unions or marriages), as well as for cultural, familial, and religious acceptance of lesbian orientations and relationships. Etymology Sappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytilene by Simeon Solomon, 1864 The word lesbian is the demonym of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho.[3] Some of Sappho\u0027s surviving poetry discusses her love for other women.[6]: 47–49  Before the mid-19th century,[7] the word lesbian referred to any aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.[a] A shift of the word to describe erotic relationships between women had been documented in 1870.[9] In 1875, a critic referred to Baudelaire\u0027s poem \"Delphine and Hippolyte\" (a poem about love between two women, and without reference to Lesbos) as \"Lesbian\".[10] In 1890, the term lesbian was used in the National Medical Dictionary as an adjective to describe tribadism.[11] The terms lesbian, invert and homosexual were interchangeable with sapphist around the turn of the 20th century.[9] The use of lesbian in medical literature became prominent; by 1925, the word was recorded as a noun to mean the female equivalent of sodomite.[9][12] Sexuality and identity Lesbian community flag introduced in social media in 2018, with the dark orange stripe representing gender variance[13][14] Lesbian feminist flag consisting of a labrys (a double-bladed axe) within the inverted black triangle, set against a violet-hue background. The labrys represents lesbian strength.[15] Lesbian flag derived from the colors of the lipstick lesbian flag design[16][17] Biological factors Further information: Biology and sexual orientation Prenatal androgen exposure correlates with same-sex sexual behavior in women.[18] Biological characteristics known to be affected by prenatal hormone exposure have been shown to vary by sexual orientation in women.[19][20] The finding that digit ratios (one characteristic affected by prenatal hormone exposure) differ between lesbian and heterosexual women has been replicated in cross-cultural studies.[20] Neuroimaging studies have found differences between heterosexual and homosexual women in neurological structures, including both those known to be affected by prenatal androgen exposure[21] and those not known to be affected by prenatal androgen exposure.[22][23] A later meta-analysis concluded that the small sample sizes and small number of studies meant that findings were inconclusive as of 2021.[24] Genetics also play a role; around 20% of the variance of sexual orientation in",

It was established by an Act of Parliament in 1968.[1] Previously known as the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), the organisation was renamed as ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute on 12 August 2015, in honour of Singapore\u0027s first President, Yusof Ishak.[2] The institute celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivering a lecture[3] on 13 March that year. According to its website, the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute\u0027s primary objectives are: To be a leading research centre dedicated to the study of socio-political, security, and economic trends and developments in Southeast Asia and its wider geo-strategic and economic environment; To stimulate research and debate within scholarly circles, enhance public awareness of the region, and facilitate the search for viable solutions to the varied problems confronting the region; To nurture a community of scholars interested in the region and to engage in research on the multi-faceted dimensions and issues of stability and security, economic development, and political, social and cultural change. The institute conducts a range of research programmes; holds conferences, workshops, lectures and seminars; publishes briefs, research journals and books; and generally provides a range of research support facilities, including a large library collection. Research programmes [edit] Regional Economic Studies Regional Strategic and Political Studies Regional Social and Cultural Studies Country Studies Programmes [edit] The country-focused programmes are meant to complement the institute\u0027s three basic disciplinary programmes, with the cross-affiliation of researchers between the two sets of programmes helping to encourage research projects which are more comparative in nature and are conceptually bolder. The five country-specific programmes are Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam (including Indochina).[4] Research Centres [edit] ASEAN Studies Centre Established in 2008 to research on issues pertaining to the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as an institution and a process. Singapore APEC Study Centre Established in 1994 to research, disseminates information, facilitates discussions on APEC-related issues, and promotes linkages with other APEC Study Centres. Temasek History Research Centre Established in 2019 to research Singapore\u0027s pre-modern history, its economic and socio-cultural links to the region, as well as its historical role as a trading centre. ISEAS Publishing [edit] The publishing arm of the institution has produced more than 2,000 titles, consisting of books and journals, since the early 1970s.[5] ISEAS Publishing is the largest scholarly publisher of research about south-east Asia and Asia-Pacific from within the region and works with many other academic and trade publishers and distributors to disseminate important research and analyses from and about south-east Asia to the rest of the world. In recent years, ISEAS has published an average of 50 new titles a year. In addition, ISEAS Publishing issues the institute\u0027s three tri-annual academic journals: Journal of Southeast Asian Economies;[6][7] Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia;[8] and Contemporary Southeast Asia,[9] as well as the annual Southeast Asian Affairs.[10] ISEAS books and journals are distributed to over 100 countries worldwide, and are available in both electronic and print versions, via the bookshop located within the institute, and its website.[11] ISEAS Library [edit] The library houses over half a million items related to south-east Asia in the area of economics, politics, international relations, culture, and social studies. The collections, built up over decades, are both historical and contemporary, including a range of multimedia titles.[12] The ISEAS library is open to all members of the public interested in the study of the south-east Asian region.

They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like [[Category:XYZ]] in its wiki markup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ. Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships. Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page. Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles (or other pages) that have been added to that particular category. There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation. The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename—and the category itself. Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques. (See also the search box parameter \"incategory\".) The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below. Summary The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories, to which any editable page can be added. To add a page to a category, include \"[[Category:Category name]]\" or \"[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]\" in that page\u0027s wiki markup. The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page. A category is usually associated with a category page in the \"Category:\" namespace.[1] A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories. The bottom of a Wikipedia article on Chicken eyeglasses.

By clicking on the category link at the bottom of the page, readers can navigate the Category tree. Category page definition A category page is any page in the Category namespace. They each act as a category, and are termed a \"category\". The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other \"categories\", and one section titled Pages, listing pages as categorized (in other namespaces). New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace. A category page can be edited like any other page. However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows: First a count and list of subcategories (other categories belonging to the category) is shown, if any exist. The name of each subcategory is followed by counts like \"(6 C, 38 P, 2 F)\", meaning this subcategory contains 6 subcategories, 38 pages, and 2 files. Counts of 0 are omitted.

The groups allowed cross-dressers to meet others, learn cross-dressing tips, and lessened the shame and stigma surrounding cross-dressing.[12] Tri-Ess has historically excluded members who were drag-performers or known or suspected to be gay, bisexual, or transsexual.[12][13] This was reflective of Prince\u0027s beliefs that the \"true tranvestite\" is \"exclusively heterosexual\", \"frequently ... married and often fathers\", and \"values his male organs, enjoys using them and does not desire them removed\". Prince was also known for expressing homophobic sentiments and was a leading opponent of gender-affirming surgery.[14] Tri-Ess representatives served on the board of directors for the International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE) and helped found the Southern Comfort Conference, an annual gathering of transgender people, in 1991. Representatives also were on the board of the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition (GenderPAC), one of the first national trans civil rights organizations in the U.S.[15] Beecroft served as the first President of Tri-Ess and worked to make the organization more inclusive, forming alliances with trans women and gay/bisexual men. She began Tri-Ess\u0027s journal, The Femme Mirror, which she edited for over a decade, initiated a confidential mail service, and organized a project to donate books on cross-dressing to local libraries. She also started the annual \"Holiday En Femme\" event, where members could meet in November and go out cross-dressed, sometimes the only opportunity for members to be feminine in public.[15] In 1988, Jane Ellen Fairfax was elected chair of the board of directors. Fairfax focused greater attention on the needs of the partners of members, granting them full membership status when they had previously been considered \"guests\". She started The Sweetheart Connection, a quarterly newsletter by and for wives, and the \"Spouses’ and Partners’ International Conference for Education\". During her tenure, her wife Mary became editor of The Femme Mirror and expanded its content.[15] At its height in the early 2000s, Tri-Ess had 25 chapters nationwide that sponsored social events and sessions on legal issues, self-defense, coming out, and feminine dressing. By 2020, only 6 chapters remained.[15] Membership, publications, and programs [edit] The Femme Mirror A quarterly magazine covering a wide range of topics in crossdressing, including coming out stories, community news, etc. Sweetheart Connection A quarterly newsletter produced by wives, for wives of other crossdressers.[15][16] Big Sister Program New members joining Tri-Ess have the option of being assigned a correspondence Big Sister, serves a supportive role during their first year of membership.[citation needed] Pen Pal Program For members who live far away from any chapters, Tri-Ess has a Pen Pal program.[citation needed] Sisters Across the Sea Program This program encourages international correspondence between Tri-Ess chapters in the United States and similar organizations abroad.[citation needed] Holiday en femme A holiday for crossdressers, hosted each November.[15] Spouses\u0027 and Partners\u0027 International Conference on Education (SPICE) Non-crossdressed event for wives and couples.[15] See also [edit] List of transgender-related topics List of transgender-rights organizations Queer heterosexuality References [edit] ^ Dear Abby (23 October 2013). \"His cross-dressing isn\u0027t a secret anymore\".

Chibados (or quimbandas)[1] are third-gender people, born male, who lived most often as women. They were found among the cultures of the Ndongo and other parts of what is today Angola. They were first described in the west by the Portuguese. Chibados were involved as \"spiritual arbiters in political and military decisions\" and also performed burials.[2] Olfert Dapper described the chibados as shamans \"who walk dressed like women.\"[3] Portuguese priests and Jesuits described how chibados lived as women and were able to marry other men with no social sanctions. Instead, \"such marriages were honored and even prized.\"[4] Chibados made up a separate caste and elders referred to themselves as \"Grandmother.\"[5] Queen Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba had over fifty chibados in her court.[6] The chibados were said to be used by Nzinga as concubines.[3] As the Portuguese gained more control in Africa, colonial laws introduced and increased homophobia.[7] References [edit] Citations [edit] ^ Sweet 2003, p. 55-56. ^ Sweet 2003, p. 56. ^ a b Bleys, Rudi C.

Armed with an AR-15–style rifle,[1] the gunman, John Earnest, fatally shot one woman and injured three other people, including the synagogue\u0027s rabbi. After fleeing the scene, Earnest phoned 9-1-1 and reported the shooting. He was apprehended in his car approximately two miles (3.2 km) from the synagogue by a San Diego police officer. A month before the shooting, Earnest had attempted to burn down a mosque in Escondido. In September 2021, Earnest was sentenced by a state court in San Diego County to life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus an additional 121 years to life and another 16 years as part of a plea agreement. In December, he was sentenced in federal court to life in prison with no chance of parole, plus 30 years, with the federal and state life sentences running consecutively instead of concurrently. Shooting [edit] At approximately 11:23 a.m. PDT, a gunman, identified as 19-year-old John Earnest, entered the Chabad of Poway synagogue on the last day of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which fell on a Shabbat. Approximately 100 people were inside the synagogue at the time.[2][3] Earnest carried a Smith \u0026 Wesson Model M\u0026P 15 Sport II semi-automatic rifle and was wearing a tactical vest containing five magazines of ten rounds each.[4][5] In the foyer, he shot and killed 60-year-old Lori Gilbert-Kaye with two bullets, and then wounded Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who had founded the congregation.[6][5][7] According to witnesses, Gilbert-Kaye had tried to shield the rabbi from the gunman.[8][9][10] Earnest then turned to a side room occupied by several people, including a number of children.[5] He fired into the room, wounding one man with a bullet to the leg, and his 8-year-old niece.[5] He fired eight to ten rounds before his rifle jammed or malfunctioned,[8] which prevented additional casualties.[11] Two members of the congregation ran toward the shooter.[12] Earnest then fled the synagogue, entering a Honda sedan.[3][13] All the injured were expected to recover.[3][9] Goldstein, who had been shot in the hand, lost his right index finger from the shooting, despite four hours of surgery.[6][14] After Earnest fled, Goldstein spoke to the congregation despite his injury, telling them to stay strong.[15] Jonathan Morales, an off-duty United States Border Patrolman who was a member of the synagogue,[16] opened fire and hit Earnest\u0027s car multiple times, but he fled uninjured.[3][12][16][17] Excerpts from the 911 call Problems playing this file? See media help. Shortly thereafter, the shooter phoned 9-1-1 and reported the shooting himself.[2] Earnest was apprehended approximately two miles (3.2 km) from the synagogue by a San Diego police officer responding to the shooting. Earnest left his car and surrendered, and was taken into custody without incident.[17] The rifle, a tactical helmet, and five loaded 10 round magazines, were recovered from Earnest\u0027s car. Earnest was wearing a tactical vest when he was arrested.[8] Surveillance cameras at the synagogue captured video of the shooting.[8] The attack occurred exactly six months after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.[10] Perpetrator [edit] 2022 mugshot image of Earnest John Timothy Earnest (born June 8, 1999),[18] a then 19-year-old male from the San Diego neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos, was identified as the shooter.[19][20] He was a 2017 graduate of Mt. Carmel High School and a nursing school student at California State University San Marcos.[20][21] Officials said he had no previous criminal record or contacts with police, and no known connection to any white supremacist group.[19][22] Earnest was a member of the Escondido Orthodox Presbyterian Church, which is affiliated with the theologically traditionalist Orthodox Presbyterian Church.[23] Earnest had recently expressed white supremacist views to his college classmates and family, including saying that he studied Adolf Hitle",

(July 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Queer art, also known as LGBT+ art or queer aesthetics, broadly refers to modern and contemporary visual art practices that draw on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and various non-heterosexual, non-cisgender imagery and issues.[1][2][3] While by definition there can be no singular \"queer art\", contemporary artists who identify their practices as queer often call upon \"utopian and dystopian alternatives to the ordinary, adopt outlaw stances, embrace criminality and opacity, and forge unprecedented kinships and relationships.\"[4] Queer art is also occasionally very much about sex and the embracing of unauthorised desires.[4] Queer art is highly site-specific, with queer art practices emerging very differently depending on context, the visibility of which possibly ranging from being advocated for, to conversely being met with backlash, censorship, or criminalisation.[5] With sex and gender operating differently in various national, religious, and ethnic contexts, queer art necessarily holds varied meanings.[5] While historically, the term \u0027queer\u0027 is a homophobic slur from the 1980s AIDS crisis in the United States, it has been since re-appropriated and embraced by queer activists and integrated into many English-speaking contexts, academic or otherwise.[4] International art practices by LGBT+ individuals are thus often placed under the umbrella term of \u0027queer art\u0027 within English-speaking contexts, even though they emerge outside the historical developments of the gender and identity politics of the United States in the 1980s. \u0027Queer art\u0027 has also been us",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Derogatory epithet For other uses, see Twat (disambiguation). Twat is an English-language vulgarism which means the vulva or vagina, and is used figuratively as a derogatory epithet.[1][2][3] In British English and Irish English it is a common insult referring to an obnoxious or stupid person regardless of gender;[1][3] in American English, it is rarer and usually used to insult a woman.[1][2][4] In Britain and Ireland, the usual pronunciation rhymes with hat, while Americans most often use the older pronunciation that rhymes with squat. This is reflected in the former variant spelling of twot.[5] The literal sense is first attested in 1656, the epithet in the 1930s.[5] The word\u0027s etymology is uncertain. The American Heritage Dictionary suggests a conjectural Old English word thwāt, meaning \u0027a cut\u0027, cognate with the Old Norse þveit (thveit).[4] Jonathon Green suggests a connection with twitchel, a dialect term for a narrow passage.[5] The 20th-century British slang verb twat, meaning \u0027to hit, whack\u0027, is probably an unrelated homonym of onomatopoeic origin.[1][6] Historical use Road sign pointing to Twatt, Shetland, which was ranked No. 4 of the most vulgar-sounding names in Rude Britain, alongside Twatt, Orkney, also in Scotland Robert Browning famously misused the term in his 1841 poem \"Pippa Passes\":[7][8] Then owls and bats Cowls and twats Monks and nuns in a cloister\u0027s moods Adjourn to the oak-stump pantry Many years later, Frederick J. Furnivall wrote to ask Browning what he meant by twat; Browning replied that as a youth he had encountered the word in a volume of broadsides and inferred it to be an item of nun\u0027s clothing akin to a wimple.[7][9][10] The relevant lines are from Vanity of Vanities, a 1660 attack on Henry Vane the Younger which includes an anti-Catholic joke:[9][11] They talk\u0027t of his having a Cardinalls Hat They\u0027d send him as soon an Old Nuns Twat Melissa Mohr suggests few Victorians knew the word, given that \"none of the twenty-three or so Victorian editions\" of Browning\u0027s poem omit it.[9] An 1868 query to Notes and Queries asked what the word in the poem meant;[12] the only published reply was, \"Twat is good Somersetshire dialect for a toad\u003dtwoad\u003dtwat\".[13] A footnote in William James Rolfe and Heloise Hersey\u0027s 1886 Select Poems of Robert Browning summarised his reply to Furnivall with the additional comment, \"Twat is in no dictionary\";[14] H. W. Fay noted in 1888 in The Academy that the word was in fact in Thomas Wright\u0027s 1857 Dictionary of Obsolete and Provincial English, and said Browning, Furnivall and Rolfe had all made a \"distressing blunder\".[9][7][15] The 1894 reprint of Select Poems replaced the comment with \"Browning would not have used the word if he had known its meaning\".[16] In 1911 Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve alluded to \"a notorious word which smirches the skirt of Pippa Passes\".[17] Browning\u0027s error posed a dilemma for many pre-1960s lexicographers, who excluded words deemed obscene but aspired to include all words used by major writers like Browning. The 1890 Century Dictionary included the correct definition, labelled \"vulgar\", and noted Browning\u0027s \"supposition\" of its meaning.[18] In 1934 Webster\u0027s Second New International Dictionary\u0027s entry for twat read: \"Some part of a nun\u0027s garb. Erron. Browning\".[19] The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) included many taboo words, albeit often with circumscribed definition and quotations,[20] and twat was duly included in the relevant OED fascicle, published in 1916. The entry labelled it \"low\" and obsolete and noted Browning\u0027s \"erroneous\" use.[21] There was no direct definition, but rather \"See quot. 1727\", a reference to the latest of the entry\u0027s five historical citations, namely the definition in the 1727 Universal Etymological English Dictionary, which was in Neo-Latin: pudendum muliebre (\"female private part\").[21][22] Two of the other OED citations included quotes: Vanity of Vanities and a c. 1704 bawdy verse with a variant spelling: \"At last, as groping thro\u0027 a dang\u0027rous Street, / Where Stones and Twaits in frosty Winters meet\".[21][23] The two unquoted citations were a 1656 translation of Martial\u0027s Epigrams[21][24] and a 1719 bawdy song by Thomas d\u0027Urfey.[21][25] In 1986 the Supplement to the OED deleted the \"obsolete\" label and added twentieth-century quotations and the figurative insult as a second sense.[26][22] Besides Thomas Wright\u0027s 1857 dialect dictionary (\"twat pudendum f.\"[27]) the word also appears in Joseph Wright\u0027s 1892 Grammar of the Dialect of Windhill (\"twot pudendum fem.\"[28]) but not in the latter\u0027s 1905 English Dialect Dictionary.[29] The 1950s Survey of English Dialects recorded the word at several sites as the term for a cow\u0027s vulva.[30] Edward Bulwer-Lytton\u0027s 1870 science fiction novel The Coming Race, uses it to mean tadpole in an apparent satire on Darwin: Among the pithy sayings which, according to tradition, the philosopher bequeathed to posterit",

The term \"transgender\" is multi-faceted and complex, especially where consensual and precise definitions have not yet been reached. While often the best way to find out how people identify themselves is to ask them, not all persons who might be thought of as falling under the transgender \u0027umbrella\u0027 identify as such.[1] Transgender can also be distinguished from intersex, a term for people born with sex characteristics \"that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies\".[2] Books and articles written about transgender people or culture are often outdated by the time they are published, if not already outdated at the time of composition, due to inappropriate and/or outdated questions or premises.[3] Psychology, medicine, and social sciences research, aid, or otherwise interact with or study transgender people. Each field starts from a different point of view, offers different perspectives, and uses different nomenclature. This difference is mirrored by the attitude of transgender people regarding transgender issues, which can be seen in the articles listed below.[4] People and behaviour [edit] Transgender Trans man Trans woman Transgender youth List of transgender people Transsexual Non-binary List of people with non-binary gender identities Genderfluidity Gender neutrality Androgyny Gender bender Gender variance Packing (phallus) Tucking Chest binding Breast prostheses Shemale Third gender Transsexual pornography Other gender non-conforming behaviour [edit] Cross-dressing Drag Drag queen Drag king AFAB queen Travesti Pantomime dame Feminization (sexual activity) Transvestic fetishism In non-Western cultures [edit] Akava\u0027ine (Cook Islands) Bakla (Phili",

It is the force which upholds compulsory sexuality, the social systems and structures which privilege or incentivize sexual relationships over single individuals.[1][2] The term could be considered an expansion of heteronormativity, the idea that heterosexuality is the default or normative sexuality. The term is often used when discussing the pathologization,[3] erasure,[4] and dehumanization[5] of asexual and aromantic individuals in society, media, and within academic discourses. Etymology [edit] Allonormativity was derived from allosexual, which in turn was derived from the Greek prefix allo-, meaning different or other, and -sexual, i.e., attraction directed towards a target outside the self. The second element, -normativity, refers to the societal worldview which deems allosexuality as normal or desired. Effects [edit] Allonormativity, by its definition, denies the existence of asexual identity in humans. Thus, growing up in an allonormative society may lead to asexual individuals feeling broken or isolated prior to or even after learning about asexuality.[4][6] Because allonormativity presents asexuality as deviant, it also contributes to the pathologization of and discrimination against asexual people.[7][8] See also [edit] Amatonormativity Compulsory heterosexuality References [edit] ^ Hart-Brinson, Peter; Tlachac, M.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Surgical procedure An Adam\u0027s apple Chondrolaryngoplasty (commonly called tracheal shave, but this is a misnomer as the trachea is not involved) is a surgical procedure in which the thyroid cartilage is reduced in size by shaving down the cartilage through an incision in the throat, generally to aid those who are uncomfortable with the girth of their Adam\u0027s apple.[1][2] An alternative to this procedure is feminization laryngoplasty, albeit this procedure involves additional risks and has an effect on the voice that the patient may not desire.[3] Surgery [edit] The technique was originally described by Francis G. Wolfort and Richard G. Parry[4] and has been developed since.[5] After an anesthetic (local or general,[5] depending on whether or not it is the only surgery to be performed) is administered to the patient, a small, horizontal incision is made on the bottom of the Adam\u0027s apple. The muscles in the throat are then held apart with forceps,[4] and the protruding cartilage is shaved down with a scalpel, thus making the throat appear smoother and less angular. The incision is then closed with sutures, and a red line will mark the incision for about six weeks. Little scarring occurs in most cases because the surgeon will usually make the incision in one of the minuscule folds of skin that cover the Adam\u0027s apple.[4] Newer versions of this surgery also exist wherein the incision is hidden beneath the chin, or alternatively inside the mouth. In these cases, the tracheal shave is then typically performed endoscopically. The surgery is usually outpatient unless it is combined with other surgeries that require hospital stays.[1] Particular care must be taken by the surgeon to not remove too much cartilage, as doing so can reduce the structure of the trachea and cause breathing difficulties.[citation needed] Most surgeons who specialize in gender affirming surgery offer the procedure, and some general plastic surgeons will as well. It is one of the more common surgeries performed on transgender women, along with genital reconstruction. Due to the proximity of the vocal folds, there is the small possibility that they may be damaged during this type of surgery. Generally, however, the patient\u0027s voice is unaffected, although there have been reports of slight change in pitch. Some patients will choose to undergo additional vocal surgery at the same time in order to minimize voice-related dysphoria.[6] If the patient\u0027s voice is affected, they can choose to undergo feminization laryngoplasty to resolve these issues and retighten the vocal folds. Feminization laryngoplasty is also capable of further reducing the Adam\u0027s apple after a tracheal shave if the patient finds the reduction done after an initial shave inadequate, as it explicitly removes tissue that is normally avoided by the surgeon during a tracheal shave. Recovery [edit] It is recommended by many surgeons that the patient frequently rub the site of the incision to prevent noticeable scar tissue from forming. Swelling and bruising around the site of the incision is common, and patients may also experience difficulty swallowing and speaking, to a greater or lesser degree depending on the individual.[7] The average time for complete recovery is about two weeks, although it can sometimes take longer if the patient has pre-existing medical conditions such as anemia.[citation needed] The majority of patients are satisfied with the outcome of this surgery.[5][8] The most common complaints from those unsatisfied are that they still feel that their Adam\u0027s apple is too big or that the scar is too noticeable.[8] Issues with the Adam\u0027s apple being too big after a tracheal shave can potentially be solved with feminization laryngoplasty.

Opponents of LGBTQ rights may object to the decriminalization of homosexuality, laws permitting civil unions or partnerships, same-sex parenting and adoption, the inclusion of LGBTQ people in the military, access to assisted reproductive technology, and gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for transgender individuals. Organizations that oppose LGBTQ rights often resist the enactment of laws legalizing same-sex marriage, the passage of anti-discrimination legislation aimed at curbing discrimination against LGBTQ people (including in employment and housing), the adoption of anti-bullying laws to protect LGBTQ minors, the decriminalization of same-gender relationships, and other related laws.[1] These groups are often religious or socially conservative in nature.[2][3][4][5] Such opposition can be motivated by homophobia,[1][4] transphobia,[1][4] bigotry,[1][3][4] animosity,[1][3][4][6] religion,[2][3][4][5] moral beliefs,[2][3][4][5] political ideologies,[2][3][4][5] or other factors. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"natural law theory offers the most common intellectual defense for differential treatment of gays and lesbians\".[7] Dag Øistein Endsjø, a Norwegian scholar and professor of religious studies, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, have stated that religious belief underpins most forms of opposition to LGBTQ rights.[8] History [edit] German Student Union members plunder the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in preparation to burn its books, May 1933 The first organized gay rights movement arose in the late nineteenth century in Germany.[9] In the 1920s and into the early 1930s, there were LGBTQ communities in cities like Berlin; German-Jewish sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld was one of the most notable spokespeople for LGBTQ rights at this time. When the Nazi party came to power in 1933, one of the party\u0027s first acts was to burn down Hirschfeld\u0027s Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, where many prominent Nazis had been treated for perceived sexual problems.[10][11] Initially tolerant to the homosexuality of Ernst Röhm and his followers, many gay men were purged from the Nazi Party following the Night of the Long Knives and the Section 175 Laws began to be enforced again, with gay men interned in concentration camps by 1938.[a] Under the Nazi rule in Germany, the dismantling of rights for LGBTQ individuals was approached in two ways. By strengthening and re-enforcing existing laws that had fallen into disuse, male homosexuality was effectively re-criminalised; homosexuality was treated as a medical disorder, but at a social level rather than individual level intended to reduce the incidence of homosexuality. The treatment was a program of eugenics, starting with sterilisation, then a system of working people to death in forced labour camps, and eventually refined by medical scientists to include euthanasia. The driving force was the elimination of perceived degeneracy at various levels – genetic, social, identity and practice, and the elimination of such genetic material in society. Lifton wrote about this in his book The Nazi Doctors:[12] Graph of convictions under Germany\u0027s Paragraph 175. Spike occurs during Nazi era, and dropoff after partial repeal in 1969. [...] sexology and defense of homosexuality [...] were aspects of \"sexual degeneration, a breakdown of the family and loss of all that is decent,\" and ultimately the destruction of the German Folk.

Opinions vary on how to categorize historical accounts of gender-variant people and identities. The galli, eunuch priests of classical antiquity, have been interpreted by some scholars as transgender or third-gender. The trans-feminine kathoey and hijra gender roles have persisted for thousands of years in Thailand and the Indian subcontinent, respectively. In Arabia, khanith (like earlier mukhannathun) have occupied a third gender role attested since the 7th century CE. Traditional roles for transgender women and transgender men have existed in many African societies, with some persisting to the modern day. North American Indigenous fluid and third gender roles, including the Navajo nádleehi and the Zuni lhamana, have existed since pre-colonial times. Some medieval European documents have been studied as possible accounts of transgender persons. Kalonymus ben Kalonymus\u0027s lament for being born a man instead of a woman has been seen as an early account of gender dysphoria. John/Eleanor Rykener, a male-bodied Briton arrested in 1394 while living and doing sex work dressed as a woman, has been interpreted by some contemporary scholars as transgender. In Japan, accounts of transgender people go back to the Edo period. In Indonesia, there are millions of trans-/third-gender waria, and the extant pre-Islamic Bugis society of Sulawesi recognizes five gender roles. In the United States in 1776, the genderless Public Universal Friend refused both birth name and gendered pronouns. Transgender American men and women are documented in",

History [edit] Main article: Butch and femme Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, butch became a central identity in the lesbian community.[6] It was often understood in conjunction with femme identity, and butch–femme relations have been studied at great length.[7] As a result, butch identity on its own remains somewhat ill-defined.[7] Butch people are often described as sexually dominant lesbians who are interested in having sex with femmes.[7] The Queen\u0027s Vernacular claimed a butch was \"a lesbian with masculine characteristics.\"[8] In Of Catamites and Kings, Gayle Rubin describes a butch as those lesbians who use masculine mannerisms, and/or who wear traditionally male clothing, and/or who e",

These relationships were particularly cherished by aliʻi nui (chiefs) and the male and female kaukaualiʻi performing a hana lawelawe or expected service with no stigma attached.[1] There were several Hawaiian terms to describe aikāne including hoʻokamaka and noho ai (a poetic form that translates to ‘one to lie with’).[2] Moe aikāne were celebrated in many moʻolelo (legends and history), including the Pele and Hiʻiaka epics. Most of the major chiefs, including Kamehameha I, had moe aikāne. Lieutenant James King stated that \"all the chiefs had them\" and recounts a tale that Captain Cook (the first European explorer to Hawaii) was asked by one chief to leave King behind, considering such an offer a great honor. Kamehameha III was aikāne to Kaomi Moe, whom he elevated to the position of mōʻi kuʻi, aupuni kuʻi (joint king and joint ruler) and played an important role in perpetuating hula and other indigenous traditions and promoting literacy. David Samwell, the surgeon aboard Cook’s ship, wrote in his journals in January of 1779: “Of this class [of aikane] are Palea and Kanekoa, and their business is to commit the Sin of Onan [oral sex] upon the old King [Kamehameha I]. This, however strange it may appear, is fact, as we learnt from the frequent Enquiries about this curious Custom, and it is an office that is esteemed honourable amoung them.”[3] A number of Cook\u0027s crew related tales of the tradition with great disdain. American adventurer and sailor John Ledyard commented in detail about the tradition as he perceived it. Th",

Not to be confused with Femboy. For other uses, see Fembot (disambiguation). Vyommitra (Indian Space Research Organisation, 2020) A gynoid, robotess or fembot is a feminine humanoid robot. The depiction of gynoids in science fiction films and artwork is a noted cultural phenomenon, with questions being posed about sexualization and use as sex objects. As the design of more realistic humanoid robot design becomes technologically possible, gynoids are also emerging in real-life robotic applications. Name [edit] The adjective gynoid means \"resembling or pertaining to the female human form\". Though the term android has been used to refer to robotic humanoids regardless of apparent gender, the Greek prefix \"andr-\" refers to man in the masculine sense.[1] The term gynoid was first used by Isaac Asimov in a 1979 editorial, as a theoretical female equivalent of the word android.[2] Other possible names for feminine robots exist. The portmanteau \"fembot\" (feminine or female robot) was used as far back as 1959, in Fritz Leiber\u0027s The Silver Eggheads, applying specifically to non-sentient female sexbots.[3] It was popularized by the television series The Bionic Woman in the episode \"Kill Oscar\" (1976)[4] and later used in the Austin Powers films,[5] among others. \"Robotess\" is the oldest female-specific term, originating in 1921 from Rossum\u0027s Universal Robots, the same source as the term \"robot\". Feminine robots [edit] Ai-Da, the gynoid artist, at Abu Dhabi Art (2019) ...the great majority of robots were either machine-like, male-like or child-like for the reasons that not only are virtually all roboticists male, but also that fembots posed greater technical difficulties. Not only did the servo motor and platform have to be \u0027interiorized\u0027 (naizō suru), but the body [of the fembot] needed to be slender, both extremely difficult undertakings. —Tomotaka Takahashi, roboticist[6] Examples of notable feminine robots include: EveR-1[7] Actroid, designed by Hiroshi Ishiguro to be \"a perfect secretary who smiles and flutters her eyelids\"[8] HRP-4C[9] Meinü robot[10][11] Ai-Da, the world\u0027s first robot art system to be embodied as a humanoid robot.[12][13] Vyommitra (Sanskrit: Vyōma \u0027space\u0027, Mitra \u0027friend\u0027) is a female humanoid robot designed for space travel. She was developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to function aboard the spacecraft Gaganyaan, a crewed orbital spacecraft. Researchers note the connection between the design of feminine robots and roboticists\u0027 assumptions about gendered appearance and labor. Fembots in Japan, for example, are designed with slenderness and grace in mind,[14] and they are employed to help to maintain traditional family structures and politics in a nation of population decline.[15] People\u0027s reactions to fembots are also attributable to gender stereotypes. Research in this area is aimed at elucidating gender cues, clarifying which behaviors and aesthetics elicit a stronger gender-induced response.[16] Sexualization [edit] See also: Sex robot \"Sweetheart\", shown with its creator, Clayton Bailey; the feminine robot (also a functional coffee maker) created a controversy after it was displayed at the Lawrence Hall of Science at University of California, Berkeley. Gynoids may be \"eroticized\", and some examples such as Aiko include sensitivity sensors in their breasts and genitals to facilitate sexual response.[17] The fetishization of gynoids in real life has been attributed to male desires for custom-made passive women and compared to life-size sex dolls.[18] However, some science fiction works depict them as femmes fatales, fighting the establishment or being rebellious.[19][20] In 1983, a female robot named \"Sweetheart\" was removed from a display at the Lawrence Hall of Science; the robot\u0027s breasts, perceived as an exaggerated feature, resulted in a petition being presented claiming it was insulting to women. The robot\u0027s creator, Clayton Bailey, a professor of art at California State University, Hayward called this \"censorship\" and \"next to book burning\".[21] In fiction [edit] See also: List of fictional gynoids The theme of the artificial woman has a long history in both fiction and mythology, dating back to the ancient Greeks, as exemplified by the myth of Pygmalion. In science fiction, the depiction of female-appearance robots is often characterized by their use as domestic servants or sexual slaves. This trope is exemplified in various literary and cinematic works, including the film Westworld, the novel Fairyland (1995) by Paul J. McAuley, and the short story \"Helen O\u0027Loy\" (1938) by Lester del Rey.[22] These robots have sometimes also been depicted as warriors, killers, or laborers.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Public places in Australia used for gay encounters Parts of the natural bushland of Sydney\u0027s North Head have historically served as a meeting place for gay men in Sydney. In Australia, the term beat is used to refer to an area frequented by gay men, where sexual acts occur. This use of the word parodies the beat walked by a police officer or a prostitute. Most commonly, public toilets, parks, and nightclubs are used as beats, though sometimes suburban car parks become beats after nightfall. Sex researchers have found that a considerable proportion of men who use \"beats\" are men who have sex with men (MSMs) rather than gay-identifying. This is possibly because, while gay men have a plethora of venues for meeting legitimately, MSMs – who are often closeted – may not wish to risk being observed in (or reported as attending) gay venues. History [edit] Although little is known about beats in the early colonial and Federation periods, it is known that specific areas in larger cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane have recorded histories of use for this purpose through the 20th century to the present (Moore 1995). Social and sexual behaviour in beats [edit] Presently, beats are actively used by men who have sex with men (MSM). Due to the casual nature and anonymity of most of the encounters, beats have been identified as areas of high risk for the transmission of HIV, syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections.[1][2] Law [edit] Engaging in sexual activity in a public place is against the law in all states and territories in Australia. Police have been criticised for excessive patrolling of known beats, and the defence of entrapment is commonly used by those caught when charged. People using beats are also more likely to be subject to homophobic hate crimes and other general crimes than gay men who do not use beats,[3] prompting some to welcome the police presence (Moore 1995). In Sydney and Melbourne at least, gay beats have attracted some attention from some sections of the media. This has led to a police presence at those identified.[4] There is currently a NSW Parliamentary inquiry into hate crimes (public submissions closed 7 November 2018).[5][6] See also [edit] LGBTQ portal Cottaging Gay bathhouse Gay cruising in the United Kingdom References [edit] ^ Iveson, Kurt (2007), Publics and the city, Wiley-Blackwell, p. 107, ISBN 978-1-4051-2732-5 ^ Dowsett, G W; Davis, M (1992), Transgression and intervention : homosexually active men and beats, Macquarie University, AIDS Research Unit, OCLC 221628532 ^ Callaghan, Greg (2007), Bondi badlands: the definitive story of Sydney\u0027s gay hate murders, Allen \u0026 Unwin, p. 168, ISBN 978-1-74114-619-6 ^ Harnett, Sonya (13 February 2012). \"Sex and Secrets in Public Parks\".

It is used by people of various genders: cis and trans women wishing to emphasize feminine curves and increase their physical attractiveness,[1] and cross-dressers either to pass or create an exaggerated figure, as in drag performance.[2] This technique is often used by drag queens to create the illusion of a feminine figure, often taking it to the extreme for comedic value. History [edit] People have altered their silhouettes via hip and buttock padding to achieve desired silhouette shapes for centuries. In the 1500s and 1600s in Europe, the bum roll, or roll farthingale, was used to widen the appearance of the hips in contrast to the wearer\u0027s waist and create a fashionable feminine figure.[3] Crinolines and hoop skirts were used in the 1800s, emphasizing a rounded full lower silhouette, and later a conical lower silhouette, with volume shifting towards the back. These were replaced by bustles, which appeared in 1868, and focused on keeping a flat silhouette in front while adding volume to the back.[4] Detail on a 1600 satirical engraving showing Dutch women putting on padded rolls to shape their dresses. In the 1960s, American women\u0027s undergarment fashions transitioned from shapewear and girdles to simple panties. However, the subculture of straight trans women\u0027s fashion focused strongly on shapewear in the form of breast forms and hip pads, as well as corsets and girdles. Breast forms, waist-cinchers and corsets were the most frequent ads shown in transfeminine periodicals like Transvestia during the 20th century. However, columnists frequently recommended hip and buttock padding as a way for cross-dressers and trans women to achieve proportions they had recorded as \"normal\" for women. Writers suggested hip and buttock padding for use in blending in and also for creating exaggerated feminine silhouettes.[5] Hip and buttock padding are a common element used by drag queens, used to create the silhouette of round buttocks and hips.[6] One Texan drag queen recounted that in the early 2000s, it was hard to learn costume and makeup techniques unless you were taught by other queens. He said that he initially didn\u0027t use hip pads and would pad a bra with rags, but two local queens taught him techniques including the use of foam pads. He has used foam ever since to be \"filled out properly.\" Today, YouTube tutorials and RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race shape educations in drag.[7] In the 2022 season of RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race: UK vs The World, most of the contestants used foam padding in their looks to make their hips look larger.[8] Cosplayers use hip and buttock padding to construct hyper-masculine and hyper-feminine silhouettes, whether cross-dressing or not. These practices often borrow from cross-dressing and costume techniques shared by drag performers.[9] Garment types [edit] These garments can be broadly classed as pre-made, made to measure, and homemade. Pre-made [edit] Padded underwear with pockets into which sections of padding can be inserted are marketed by companies catering to crossdressers. Many of these premade garments are often criticised for looking lumpy or false.[10] Made to measure [edit] At least one company specialises in manufacturing custom made garments specifically designed from the purchaser\u0027s measurements.[11] These garments are more expensive than pre-made or homemade garments but are generally well made. Homemade [edit] The cheapest form of hip and buttock padding is homemade. Information on making padding is available on web sites and in at least one book.[12][13] Home made padding Using the person\u0027s own measurements and a table of comparative measurements,[14] it is possible to determine how thick the padding needs to be at various places, such as the widest point on the hips and the fullest point on the buttocks. Homemade padding is usually made by cutting a block of high-density polyurethane foam rubber to shape. This is the same type of foam as used for upholstery. The most commo",

Contemporary winkte may or may not consider themselves part of the more mainstream gay, LGBTQ, or pan-Indian two-spirit communities.[1] Historically, sometimes the direction to adopt the social and spiritual aspects of this role has come in a series of dreams.[1] While historical accounts of their status vary, most accounts treated the winkte as regular members of the community, and not in any way marginalized for their status. Other accounts held the winkte as sacred, occupying a liminal, third-gender role in the culture, and born to fulfill ceremonial roles that could not be filled by either men or women.[1] In contemporary Lakota communities, attitudes toward the winkte vary from accepting to homophobic.[1][2] Etymology [edit] Sihasapa and Minneconjou Lakotan anthropologist Beatrice Medicine writes: In my childhood, we were aware of this social category, which was referred to as winkte. Linguistic analysis of this Lakota word is: win – \"woman\" kte – \"to be like\" kte – \"to kill\" (a deeper structural form) \"The common vernacular usage was winkte \"wants to be like a woman.\" We, as children, were instructed, \"There are these individuals – in all cases males (wicasa). They are different. They are winkte. Don\u0027t make fun of them. They are also Lakota,\" said our parents and grandparents.[1] References [edit] ^ a b c d e f g Medicine, Beatrice (2002). Lonner, W.

For other uses of the singular form, see Gallus. For individuals surnamed Galli and for other uses, see Galli (disambiguation). Relief of an archigallus making sacrifices to Cybele and Attis, Museo Archeologico Ostiense, Ostia Antica A gallus (pl. galli/gallae) was a eunuch priest of the Phrygian goddess Cybele (Magna Mater in Rome) and her consort Attis, whose worship was incorporated into the state religious practices of ancient Rome. Origins [edit] Cybele\u0027s cult may have originated in Mesopotamia,[1] arriving in Greece around 300 BCE.[2] It originally kept its sacred symbol, a black meteorite, in a temple called the Megalesion in Pessinus in modern Turkey. The earliest surviving references to the galli come from the Greek Anthology, a 10th-century compilation of earlier material, where several epigrams mention or clearly allude to their castrated state. Stephanus Byzantinus (6th century CE) said the name came from King Gallus,[3] while Ovid (43 BC – 17 CE) said it derived from the Gallus River in Phrygia.[4] The same word (gallus singular, galli plural) was used by the Romans to refer to Celts and to roosters, and the latter especially was a source of puns.[5] Considering the Mesopotamian connection, and the similarities between Cybele and Inanna, a common etymology between the galli and the much earlier Sumerian priests of Inanna, known as the Gala, is plausible, but this is not as yet conclusive. Arrival in Rome [edit] The cult of Magna Mater arrived in Rome sometime in the 3rd century BCE, towards the end of the Second Punic War against Carthage. There are no contemporary accounts of its arrival, but later literary sources describe its import as an official response to meteor showers, crop failures and famine in 205 BCE. The Senate and the Syblline books identified these events as prodigies, signs of divine anger against Rome and warnings of Rome\u0027s imminent destruction, which should be expiated by Rome\u0027s official import of the Magna Mater and her cult; with the goddess as an ally, Rome might see an end to the famine and victory over Carthage.[6] In 204 BCE, the Roman Senate officially adopted Cybele as a state goddess. Her cult image was brought from her sanctuary in Asia Minor, and eventually into the city, with much ceremony.[7] According to Livy, it was brought to the Temple of Victory on the Palatine Hill on the day before the Ides of April,[8] and, from then on, the anniversary was celebrated as the Megalesia on April 4–10 with public games, animal sacrifices, and music performed by the galli.[9] Over a hundred years later (according to Plutarch), when the Roman general Marius planned to fight the Germanic tribes, a priest of the galli named Bataces prophesied Roman victory and consequently the Senate voted to build a victory temple to the goddess.[10] Reception [edit] Dionysius of Halicarnassus claimed that Roman citizens did not participate in the rituals of the cult of Magna Mater. Literary sources call the galli \"half-men\" (semiviri), or \"half-women\" (ἡμίθηλυς), leading scholars to conclude that Roman men looked down upon the galli.[11] But Roman disapproval of the foreign cult may be more the invention of modern scholars than a social reality in Rome, as archaeologists have found votive statues of Attis on the Palatine hill, meaning Roman citizens participated on some level in the reverence of Magna Mater and her consort.[6] The archigallus was a Roman citizen who was also employed by the Roman State and therefore walked a narrow line: preserving cult traditions while not violating Roman religious prohibitions. Some argue that the archigallus was never a eunuch, as all citizens of Rome were forbidden from eviratio (castration).[12] (This prohibition suggests that the original galli were either Asian or slaves.) Claudius, however, lifted the ban on castration; Domitian subsequently reaffirmed it.[13] Whether or not Roman citizens could participate in the cult of Magna Mater, or whether its members were exclusively foreign-born, is therefore the subject of scholarly debate. In the provinces [edit] The 5th century CE Christian philosopher St. Augustine wrote about the Gallae in Carthage in his work The City of God. In it, he complained that they \"no later than yesterday, were going through the streets and places of Carthage with anointed hair, whitened faces, relaxed bodies, and feminine gait.\"[14] The remains of a Roman gallus from the 4th century CE were found in 2002 in what is now Catterick, England, dressed in women\u0027s clothes, in jewelry of jet, shale, and bronze, with two stones in their mouth. Pete Wilson, the senior archaeologist at English Heritage, said, \"The find demonstrates how cosmopolitan the north of England was.\" The archaeological site at Corbridge, a significant Romano-British settlement on Hadrian\u0027s Wall, has an altar to the goddess Cybele.[",

Questions implicated in transgender health care include gender variance, sex reassignment therapy, health risks (in relation to violence and mental health), and access to healthcare for trans people in different countries around the world. Gender-affirming health care can include psychological, medical, physical, and social behavioral care. The purpose of gender-affirming care is to help a transgender individual conform to their desired gender identity.[2] In the 1920s, physician Magnus Hirschfeld conducted formal studies to understand gender dysphoria and human sexuality and advocated for communities that were marginalized.[3] His research and work provided a new perspective on gender identity, gender expression, and sexuality. This was the first time there was a challenge against societal norms. In addition to his research, Hirschfeld also coined the term transvestite, which in modern terms is known as \"transgender\".[3] Hirschfeld\u0027s work was ended during the Nazi German era when many transgender individuals were arrested and sent to concentration camps.[3] Magnus Hirschfeld, 1919[3] In 1966 the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic opened; it was one of the first in the US to provide care for transgender individuals, including hormone replacement therapy, surgery, psychological counseling, and other gender affirmative healthcare.[3] The clinic required patients before a gender affirmation surgery to go through a program called \"Real Life Test\".[3][4] The Real Life Test was a program where before a gender a",

Whether the term can be applied to groups of three or more people has been disputed. One possible argument is that such a group is homosocial if composed of people of a single sex, and bisocial if composed of people of both sexes, since in the latter case each member will be interacting with people of both sexes. On the other hand, Collins English Dictionary[3] defines heterosocial as \"relating to or denoting mixed-sex social relationships\", without specification of whether it applies to relationships between two people or among larger groups, suggesting that the term can describe social interactions involving people of both sexes more generally. Historical developments [edit] The pervasiveness of heterosociality in contemporary life can lead to the obscuring of its social construction as a late development in Western history. Writing of early society, Freud considered that there was \"an unmistakable tendency to keep the sexes apart. Women live with women, men with men\".[4] Durkheim associated sexual totemism, binding men and women into two separate totemic corporations, with such a social division of the sexes.[5] Even in the twentieth century, rules of etiquette in some traditional villages dictated that men and women do not greet each other when passing in public.[6] Urbanization and modernization have seen a gradual erosion of the barriers to male/female socialising, not without significant culture wars along the way over each particular new arena. Thus, for example, part of the hostility to the Elizabethan theatre lay in the fact that men and women freely intermingled in its audience;[7] while dance halls and cabarets later offered similarly controversial new areas for heterosocial interaction,[8] as too did amusement parks.[9] In the 21st century, the challenge presented to traditional societies by the way the discourse of modernity encourages heterosociality over an older homosociality continues to be a live issue.[10] Impact on feminism [edit] The 20th century opening up of the public sphere to women[11]—work, politics, culture, education—was both fueled and fed by the feminist movement, but the increase in heterosociality which accompanied it was seen as double-edged by many feminists. On the one hand, it served to undercut older feminist homosocial bonds and support systems;[12] on the other, it split the new feminist movement, as calls for separatist feminism challenged heterosociality, let alone heterosexuality,[13] in ways many found unacceptable. Post-feminism has generally accepted heterosociality, along with a new strategy of gender mainstreaming, but not without reservations as to the exploitative aspects of (for example) raunch culture within the new 21st century public ",

According to the US Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA), some of the most common issues related to LGBTQ health are HIV/AIDS, breast and cervical cancer, hepatitis, mental health, substance use disorders, alcohol use, tobacco use, depression, access to care for transgender persons, issues surrounding marriage and family recognition, conversion therapy, refusal clause legislation, and laws that are intended to \"immunize health care professionals from liability for discriminating against persons of whom they disapprove.\"[1] These negative social stereotypes and pressure presented by the media are correlated with an increase of negative body image and declining self-worth, which can coincide with developing eating disorders and impact obesity rates.[2] LGBTQ people may face barriers to accessing healthcare on the basis of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression.[3] Many avoid or receive inferior care due to perceived or real homophobia, transphobia, or discrimination by healthcare providers and institutions.[3][4] In other words, negative personal experiences, or fear of experiencing discrimination may deter these individuals from accessing care.[5] General health issues affecting LGBTQ individuals [edit] According to the Committee on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health Issues and Research Gaps and Opportunities, there are several difficulties in conducting health research on LGBTQ populations.

A drag queen performer Pabllo Vittar, Brazilian drag queen, singer, and performer RuPaul, American drag queen, actor, and musician A drag queen is a person, usually male, who uses drag clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes. Historically, drag queens have usually been gay men, and have been a part of gay culture. People do drag for reasons ranging from self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag shows frequently include lip-syncing, live singing, and dancing. They typically occur at LGBTQ pride parades, drag pageants, cabarets, carnivals, and nightclubs. Drag queens vary by type, culture, and dedication, from professionals who star in films and spend a lot of their time in their drag personas, to people who do drag only occasionally. In most cases, women who dress as men and entertain by imitating them are called drag kings.[1] Those who do occasional drag may be from backgrounds other than the LGBT community. There is a long history of folkloric and theatrical crossdressing that involves people of all orientations. Not everyone who does drag at some point in their lives is a drag queen or a drag king. Terminology, scope, and etymology Drag queens from Buenos Aires advertising a nightclub, 1995 Drag term Main article: Drag (entertainment) The term drag may date as far back as the Elizabethan era in England,[2] whereas the first recorded use of drag in this context is from 1870.[3] There are several other possible origins.[4][5] Traditionally, drag involves cross-dressing and transforming one\u0027s sex through the use of makeup and other costume devices.[6][7] However, under newer conceptions of drag, conceivably performing an exaggerated and heightened form of one\u0027s own gender could be considered a drag performance.[8] Female impersonator Main article: Female impersonation John Hunter, State Theatre, Sydney, May 1952 The term female impersonation refers to a type of theatrical performance where a man dresses in women\u0027s clothing for the sole purpose of entertaining an audience.[9] The term female impersonator is sometimes used interchangeably with drag queen, although they are not the same.[9] For example, in 1972, Esther Newton described a female impersonator as a \"professional drag queen\".[10] She considered the term female impersonator to be the one that was (then) widely understood by heterosexual audiences.[10] However, feminist and queer studies scholar Sarah French defined a clear separation between these two terms. She defined drag as an art form associated with queer identity, whereas female impersonation comes from a wide range of gender identity paradigms, including heteronormativity. Additionally, many drag artists view drag as a lived form of self-expression or creativity, and perceive drag as something that is not limited to the stage or to performance. In contrast, female impersonation is specifically limited to performance and may or may not involve an LGBTQI point of view.[9] Female impersonation can be traced back at least as far as ancient Greece. There was little to no gender equity then, and women held a lower social status. This meant male actors would play female roles during theatrical performances.[11] This tradition continued for centuries but began to be less prevalent as motion pictures became popular. During the era of vaudeville, it was considered immodest for women to appear on stage. Due to that circumstance, some men became famous as \"female impersonators\", the most notable being Julian Eltinge. At the peak of his career, he was one of the most sought-after and highest-paid actors in the world.[12] Andrew Tribble was another early female impersonator who gained fame on Broadway and in Black Vaudeville.[13] In the twentieth century, some gender impersonators, both female and male, in the United States became highly successful performing artists in non-LGBTQ nightclubs and theaters. There was a concerted effort by these working female and male impersonators in America to separate the art of gender impersonation from queer identity, with an overt representation of working gender impersonators as heterosexual. Some of the performers were in fact cisgender heterosexual men and women, but others were closeted LGBTQI individuals due to the politics and social environment of the period. It was criminal in many American cities to be homosexual, or for LGBTQI people to congregate, and it was therefore necessary for female and male impersonators to distance themselves from identifying as queer publicly to avoid criminal charges and loss of career. The need to hide and dissociate from queer identity was prevalent among gender impersonators working in non-LGBTQ nightclubs before heteronormative audiences as late as th",

It includes both violence against LGBTQ people and LGBTQ bullying. The term covers violence against and bullying of people who are LGBTQ, as well as non-LGBTQ people whom the attacker perceives to be LGBTQ. Physical gay bashings sometimes involve extreme violence or murder; the perpetrators’s actions being based on their perceptions or assumptions of the victim\u0027s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. LGBTQ youth are more likely to report bullying than non-LGBTQ youth, particularly in schools. Victims of LGBTQ bullying may feel unsafe, resulting in depression and anxiety, including increased rates of suicide and attempted suicide. LGBTQ students may try to pass as heterosexual to escape the chance of being bullied, leading to further stress and isolation from available supports. Support organizations exist in many countries to prevent LGBTQ bullying and support victims. Some jurisdictions have passed legislation against LGBTQ bullying and harassment. Violence [edit] Main article: Violence against LGBTQ people LGBTQ people frequently experience violence directed toward their sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression.[1] This violence may be enacted by the state, as in laws prescribing punishment for homosexual acts, or by individuals. It may be motivated by biphobia, gayphobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, and transphobia. Influencing factors may be cultural, religious, or political mores and biases.[2] Bullying [edit] Main article: LGBTQ bullying Bullying of LGBTQ people, particularly LGBTQ youth, involv",

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Upskirt\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (December 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Upskirting or upskirt photography is the practice of taking photographs or videos under a person\u0027s skirt or kilt,[1] capturing an image or video of the crotch area, showing underwear such as panties, and sometimes genitalia. An \"upskirt\" is a photograph, video, or illustration which incorporates such an image, although the term may also be used to refer to the area of the body inside a skirt, usually from below and while being worn. The practice is a form of sexual fetishism or voyeurism and is similar in nature to downblouse photography. The primary ethical and legal issue relating to upskirt photography in the United States is the reasonable expectation of privacy, even in a public place. In a few countries, nonconsensual upskirting is a criminal sexual offense. Social attitudes [edit] The sudden popularity in the 1960s of the miniskirt brought the concept out onto the streets and was viewed by many as mass exhibitionism. One commentator in the 1960s said, \"In European countries ... they ban mini-skirts in the streets and say they\u0027re an invitation to rape ...\"[2] By contrast, many women viewed the new style as rebellion against previous clothing styles and as women\u0027s liberation of their own bodies. For the first time, many women felt comfortable exposing their thighs, whether on the beach in a swimsuit or in street wear, and were even relaxed when in some situations their underwear would be visible. Some upskirt and downblouse images are made with the knowledge and consent of the females affected. However, some of these images can end up being more widely distributed or being posted onto the Internet without the knowledge and consent of the subject, for example as revenge porn following a relationship breakup. Attitudes hardened with the very widespread availability and use of digital photographic and video technology, most recently camera phones.[3][4][5] Such technology was also being used to record upskirt and downblouse images for uploading onto the internet. Specialist websites came into existence where people could share such images, and terms such as \"upskirt\", \"downblouse\" and \"nipple dress\" (i.e., when an erect nipple is evident through the material of a woman\u0027s dress) came into use. Of particular concern were images of minors and of people who could be identified. Celebrities were popular victims of such efforts. Issues of privacy and reputation began to be raised. The creation and viewing of this type of image came increasingly to be described as forms of voyeurism and pornography. This was not that most of such images were sexual in nature, with most of them being quite innocent by themselves, but because of their association with the nature of the website on which they were posted and because of the size of the collections.[6] Safety shorts [edit] Professional tennis player Yaroslava Shvedova wearing safety shorts at a New York tennis match Some skirt-wearers, particularly those who are prominently in public such as female athletes and celebrities as well as schoolgirls, wear \"safety shorts\" under their skirts to protect themselves from upskirting.[7] Legality by country [edit] Many countries do not have laws which protect a person\u0027s right to personal privacy, especially in a public place, but the legal position does vary considerably. The following is a list of countries that do have laws related to this subject. This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. (May 2025) Australia [edit] All jurisdictions within Australia have passed laws making it illegal to take upskirt photos in public places without the person\u0027s consent.[8] Finland [edit] In 2010, an elderly man had his camera confiscated and was fined 12 day-fines for the act of public obscenity (which was thought to be the closest match in the criminal code), having taken dozens of upskirt photos in a shopping centre in Turku.[9] France [edit] In August of 2018, France passed its first law specifically criminalizing upskirt voyeurism, defined as \"using any means in order to perceive the private parts of a person which that person... when committed without the knowledge or consent of the person\". The law makes such offenses punishable by one year in prison and a fine of 15,000 euros.[10] Germany [edit] In November 2019, the German Bundestag approved a bill to criminalize both upskirting and \"criminalize photographing victims of accidents or pictures that\" show a dead person in a grossly offensive way; German media has referred to the latter as rubbernecking.[11] India [edit] In India, under section 66E, of the Information Techno",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Type of female entertainer in medieval Japan A painting by Katsushika Hokusai of the most famous shirabyōshi, Shizuka Gozen (Lady Shizuka), who was the lover of Minamoto no Yoshitsune.[1] Shirabyōshi (白拍子) were Japanese female entertainers in the Heian and Kamakura periods who sang songs and performed dances. They danced dressed as men.[2] The profession of shirabyōshi became popular in the 12th century. They would perform for the nobility, and at celebrations. The word shirabyōshi can also refer to the songs they sang and the dances they performed.[2] They are sometimes referred to as courtesans in the English language, but by nature they were performers. Some shirabyōshi did sometimes sleep with their patrons and give birth to nobles\u0027 children, but this was not their intended purpose as entertainers. The best known shirabyōshi were Shizuka Gozen, Giō, and Hotoke, who were featured in The Tale of the Heike. History [edit] The name shirabyōshi may be interpreted as \"white beat\" or \"simple rhythm\"; it may refer to the white suikan robe they wore, or alternatively the hyōshi (拍子) rhythm of the imayō (今様, lit. \u0027trendy\u0027) songs that they sang and danced to, which were also performed by asobi.[3][4] Shira (白) means \"white\", although scholars believe that it should be interpreted as \"plain\" (素; also pronounced shira); in this interpretation shirabyōshi therefore refers to the lack of musical accompaniment apart from the rhythmic hyōshi percussion.[5] Shirabyōshi appeared during the mid-Heian period (794–1185). During a time of transition of power and societal change, a change in fortune for some aristocratic families resulted in the daughters of these families needing to perform as shirabyōshi in order to survive. As educated and cultured ladies, they become a superior group of courtesans noted for their singing, dancing and poetry as well as beauty.[6] Shirabyōshi became popular as entertainers in the 12th century, and many women then chose to be shirabyōshi because of their popularity. A shirabyōshi was always a woman who dressed in men\u0027s attire.[7] They were popular in the late Heian and early Kamakura period in the 12th century, but during the 13th century, their status declined.[8] They disappeared around the end of the Kamakura or the beginning of the Muromachi period in the 14th century.[2] It has been said[by whom?] that the shirabyōshi culture greatly influenced Noh drama by bringing forth kusemai, an unorthodox form of dancing, and introducing it to Noh.[citation needed] Attire and appearance [edit] Shirabyōshi were recognizable for their clothing, which was Shinto-inspired. It was a man\u0027s outfit and featured the following:[9] A tate-eboshi hat; tall black hat worn at court A tachi a samurai\u0027s sword Red hakama, worn primarily by men White suikan and red suikan, a male Shinto outfit A kawahori hand fan, which men carried Shirabyōshi also wore oshiroi, white face makeup. This would cover their face and neck, and their eyebrows would be painted higher on the forehead (hikimayu). Their hair was worn simply, and was left long and pulled back into a loose ponytail secured with a ribbon called a takenaga. The tate-eboshi hat and the sword were only worn by shirabyōshi in the early period, and in later eras, they danced only in white suikan, which gave rise to the belief that shirabyōshi were named after the robe they wore.[10] Music [edit] Shirabyōshi songs were mostly based on Buddhist prayers. The songs were usually slow and rhythmic, with great meaning in the words. They also would sing imayō songs, which were poems using images of nature to convey meanings of circumstances in their lives. These songs typically had lines of seven and five syllables.[4] Trademarks of their music included their voices, the drum and the flute. Famous shirabyōshi [edit] Shizuka [edit] Shizuka, commonly referred to as Shizuka Gozen, was the concubine and lover of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the tragic hero of many folk legends. She was possibly born in 1168, and is popular in folk legends herself. She and Yoshitsune met and fell in love, but by the time she had become pregnant, Yoshitsune was on the run for his life. Shizuka was captured and taken to the shōgun, Minamoto no Yoritomo in Kamakura, Yoshitsune\u0027s older brother. There she gave birth to a son, who was, according to some versions of the tales, promptly killed by his uncle Yoritomo,[11] but survived in others. In some tales, Shizuka was then forced to perform a dance for Yoritomo and his wife Hōjō Masako at a temple celebration, where she sang a song of praise for her lover Yoshitsune. This greatly angered Yoritomo, and he intended on having her put to death but Masako begged for her life. Shizuka was freed and sought to follow Yoshitsune, but she learned of his death. She became a nun and died in 1189.[11] Her song is famous and is still sung today by geisha.[citation needed] Giō and Hotoke [edit] The story of Giō and Hot",

Rather, their femininity emerges in early childhood, and Sāmoans recognize them as distinct from typical boys.[2][3][4] Faʻafāfine are androphilic (attracted to males) and are usually very feminine.[4] They comprise up to 3.5% of the natal male population, similar to the number of androphilic natal males in the west.[5] Most self-identify as faʻafāfine, rather than men, while a small number identify as women. However, they recognize that they are distinct from females.[4] Faʻafāfine enjoy relatively high levels of acceptance in Sāmoa.[1][4] They can be seen in all areas of Sāmoan society, whether assisting as caregivers or working in government. Sāmoa\u0027s former Prime Minister Malielegaoi spoke publicly about the value of faʻafāfine in Sāmoan society.[1] History and terminology [edit] The word faʻafāfine includes the causative prefix faʻa–, meaning \"in the manner of\", and the word fafine, meaning \"woman\".[6] It is a cognate of related words in other Polynesian languages, such as Tongan: fakaleiti or fakafefine, the Cook Islands Māori: akava\u0027ine, and Māori: whakawāhine. Ultimately, Western terms like gay and transgender overlap but do not align exactly with Samoan gender terms found in the traditional culture of Sāmoa. The Sāmoan slang word mala (devastation) is a less-common term for faʻafāfine, originating in fundamentalist-influenced homophobia and transphobia.[7] Strong evidence points to Samoa being under matriarchal rule for centuries before contact with Europeans.[8] Queen Salamasina, holder of four paramount chief titles, ascended the throne in the 16th century through the shrewd maneuvering of the powerful female chieftains around her. Samoa continues to value the leadership roles of women and third gender people. There is no restriction on the transfer of chiefly titles to women or fa\u0027afafine, and there is a substantial list of past and present faʻafafine chiefs.[9] The history of faʻafāfine is difficult to trace. Nafanua, the female warrior and chief of Samoan early history, is sometimes held up as an icon of faʻafāfine.[10] Since the 1980s, the Sāmoan diaspora has given faʻafāfine a higher profile outside Samoa. Paul L. Vasey, Professor of Psychology at the University of Lethbridge, has claimed that the existence of faʻafafine supports the evolutionary psychology hypothesis of a gene that directs kin-directed altruism, which proposes that androphilia could be passed down because it is societally advantageous to have non-traditional roles.[11] The hypothesis contends that the existence of androphilia may serve the evolutionary purpose of providing avunculate support for related kin, meaning that families that include faʻafafine and members in other non-traditional roles, such as unmarried aunts and uncles, would have more time and resources to dedicate to the success of their kin. Role in Samoan society [edit] The existence of a third gender is so well-accepted in Sāmoan culture that most Sāmoans state that they have friendships with at least one faʻafāfine. However, faʻafāfine are not fully accepted in all parts of the community, such as by some fundamentalist Christian groups and traditional leaders.[citation needed] Sāmoan popular culture views faʻafafine as hard-working and dedicated to the family, in the Sāmoan tradition of tautua or service to family. Ideas of the family in Sāmoa and Polynesia include all the members of a sā, or communal family within the faʻamatai family system.[12] Traditionally, faʻafāfine follow the training of the women\u0027s daily work in an aiga (Sāmoan family group).[13][14] Faʻafāfine state that they \"loved\" engaging in feminine activities as children, such as playing with female peers, playing female characters during role play, dressing in feminine clothes, and playing with female gender-typical toys. This is in contrast to women who stated that they merely \"liked\" engaging in those activities as children. Some faʻafāfine recall believing they were girls in childhood. In Sāmoa, there is very seldom ridicule or displeasure towards a biologically male child who states that they are a girl. One study showed only a minority of parents (20 per cent) tr",

Gamergate Date August 2014 (2014-08) – 2015 (2015) Target Women in the video game industry Attack type Online harassment campaign Victims Zoë Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu, and others Perpetrators Internet trolls, particularly from 4chan, IRC, and 8chan Motive Misogyny anti-feminism anti-progressivism Inquiry FBI investigation Gamergate or GamerGate (GG)[1] was a loosely organized misogynistic online harassment campaign motivated by a right-wing backlash against feminism, diversity, and progressivism in video game culture.[2][3][4] It was conducted using the hashtag \"#Gamergate\" primarily in 2014 and 2015.[a] Gamergate targeted women in the video game industry, most notably feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian and video game developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu.[b] Gamergate began with an August 2014 blog entry called \"The Zoe Post\" by Quinn\u0027s ex-boyfriend, which falsely insinuated that Quinn had received a favorable review because of Quinn\u0027s sexual relationship with a games journalist.[13] The blog post was spread to 4chan, where many users had previously disparaged Quinn\u0027s work. This led to a campaign of harassment against Quinn, coordinated through anonymous message boards such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit.[14][15] The harassment campaign expanded to target Sarkeesian, Wu, and others who defended Quinn, and included doxing, rape threats, and death threats.[16][17][18] Gamergate proponents (\"Gamergaters\") claimed to be promoting ethics in video game journalism and protecting the \"gamer\" identity in opposition to \"political correctness\"[c] and the perceived influence of feminism and so-called social justice warriors on video game culture.[3][23] Proponents alleged there was a conspiracy between journalists and video game developers to focus on progressive social issues such as gender equality and sexism.[24][25][26] Such claims have been widely dismissed as trivial, baseless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics in gaming and journalism.[27][28][29] Several commentators in the mass media dismissed the ethics complaints as a deliberate cover for the ongoing harassment of Quinn and other women.[30][31] Gamergaters frequently denied any such harassment took place, falsely claiming it to be manufactured by the victims.[32][33] Gamergate has been described as a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, feminism in video games, social criticism in video games, and the social identity of gamers.[d] Supporters stated that it was a social movement. However, as a movement Gamergate had no clearly defined goals, coherent message, or official leaders, making it difficult to define.[37][38][24] Gamergate led figures both inside and outside the gaming industry to focus on methods of addressing online harassment, ways to minimize harm, and prevent similar events.[e] Gamergate has been viewed as contributing to the alt-right and other right-wing movements.[43][44] History Zoë Quinn and Depression Quest Game developer Zoë Quinn was the initial target of the harassment campaign. In 2013, Zoë Quinn, an independent game developer, released Depression Quest, a text-focused game designed to convey the experience of depression through a series of fictional scenarios,[45][19] based in part on Quinn\u0027s own experience with the illness.[46][47] The game received positive reviews in the gaming media and from mental health professionals, but faced backlash online from gamers who disliked its departure from typical game formats emphasizing violence and skill[20][48][49] and who opposed \"political\" intrusions into gamer culture.[48] Quinn was subjected to several months of harassment after its release,[16][25][17][50] including rape and death threats.[19][20] Quinn documented the harassment they[f] received and spoke openly to the media about it, which led to more pronounced abuse against them such as the posting of their home address online.[9] They cancelled future public appearances and ultimately fled their house out of fear for their safety.[47][52][53][54] The controversies and events that would come to be known as Gamergate began in August 2014 as a personal attack on Quinn, incited by a blog post by Quinn\u0027s former boyfriend, Eron Gjoni.[55][46][49] Called \"The Zoe Post\",[g] it was a lengthy, detailed account of their relationship and breakup[57] that included copies of personal chat logs, emails, and text messages.[50] The blog falsely implied that Quinn received a favorable review of Depression Quest in exchange for a sexual relationship with Nathan Grayson, a reporter for the gaming websites Kotaku and Rock Paper Shotgun.[13][58] Gjoni later said that he had \"no evidence\" of a sexual conflict of interest on Quinn\u0027s part.[59][h] Grayson never actually reviewed any of Quinn\u0027s games, and his only Kotaku article mentioning",

Femboy can be used as both a sexual and non-sexual term; it does not denote a specific sexual orientation or gender role. The term originated in the 1990s. It has since been popularised through internet forums and social media, starting on 4chan and expanding to other sites such as Reddit and TikTok, where hashtag trends such as \"#femboyfriday\" have received attention in the media. In gender studies, the term has also been used as an identifier for individuals on the transgender spectrum; in porn studies, the term has been seen as an identifier for a submissive role in intercourse and as exhibiting elements of sexual fantasy. Usage Etymology According to Dictionary.com, the term femboy originated at least in the 1990s. It is a compound noun from the words fem (an abbreviation of feminine and femme) and boy.[1][2] However, one early usage can be found in the 1981 release of the Abbreviations Dictionary by editor and photographer Ralph De Sola.[3] The variant femboi uses the LGBTQ term boi.[1] By 2000, the term boi[4] had come to denote \"a young, attractive gay man\". The term \"boi\" has also been used, independently of any meaning related to sexuality, as an alternate spelling for boy.[5] Definitions Collins English Dictionary defines femboy as \"a male whose appearance and behavioural traits are regarded as conventionally feminine\".[6] According to Dictionary.com, t",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Filmmaking technique This sequence from It\u0027s a Wonderful Life (1946) uses two insert shots—one of a sign and one of a record player—to add visual detail to the actions performed by Donna Reed. In film, an insert is a shot of part of a scene as filmed from a different angle and/or focal length from the master shot. Inserts cover action already covered in the master shot, but emphasize a different aspect of that action due to the different framing. An insert differs from a cutaway as cutaways cover action not covered in the master shot.[1][2][3][4] There are more exact terms to use when the new, inserted shot is another view of actors: close-up, head shot, knee shot, two shot. So the term \"insert\" is often confined to views of objects—and body parts, other than the head. Often inserts of this sort are done separately from the main action, by a second-unit director using stand-ins. Inserts and cutaways can both be vexatious for directors, as care must be taken to preserve continuity by keeping the objects in the same relative position as in the main take, and having the lighting be the same. In popular culture [edit] The 1975 movie Inserts directed by John Byrum about a pornographic film production, which starred Richard Dreyfuss and was originally released with an X rating, took its name from the double meaning that \"insert\" both refers to this film technique[5] (often used in pornographic filmmaking) and to sexual intercourse.

Variations range from basic disposable funnels to more elaborate reusable designs. Personal urination devices have increased in popularity since the 1990s. They are used for outdoor occupations and recreation, gender affirmation/safety, and medical reasons. In addition, fixed installation and relocatable urinals are available for use by females. Some designs require the user to supply their own personal female urination device, while other designs do not have this expectation. Portable devices [edit] Female urination devices are marketed towards many different groups. For sports and recreation they are sold for camping, traveling, snow sports, caving, rock climbing, diving, hunting/fishing, festivals, long car journeys, and any kind of outdoor pursuit where the toilet facilities are absent or less than desirable. People with physical restrictions such as recovery from hip surgery, broken bones, or those who find it challenging to sit or squat also benefit from these devices. Since 2005, numerous personal urination devices have appeared on the market. Products come in a variety of designs and materials such as plastic, rubber, silicone and paper; some are reusable and some are disposable. Several devices have been marketed for medical applications, and are sometimes available on prescription. Occupationally, urinary devices are used by first responders, armed forces, and other outdoor jobs. Some brands are NATO approved, and are supplied to military personnel.[citation needed] Such devices are used by trans men as \"stand-to-pee\" devices, or STPs,[2] often to combat gender dysphoria. More discreet solutions such as the \"Snee-Kee\" are specifically marketed for this purpose. Some stand-to-pee devices mimic the appearance of a penis and double as packers. Biological males may also want a urinary funnel if they have medical conditions that make it challenging or impossible for them to stand and pee. Travelmate pStyle Paper pee Fusionella Female urinals [edit] Main article: Female urinal Urinals for a greater variety of bodies have advantages of quick and hygienic use, water conservation, and less need for physical space. Speed of use can be especially important when there is high peak demand, such as in music festivals, theatrical events, sports stadiums, discos, dance clubs, and convention halls. Special fixed installation designs for female urinals have long been available, supplemented more recently by portable designs. Some designs, including squat toilets, have been considered \"unisex\", usable by either gender. The fixed designs are typically used by women in a \"hovering\" posture, standing over them with knees slightly bent. In addition, small portable urinals including sealable collection containers have been available in female-",

Such aromantics may adopt labels for more specific identities on the aromantic spectrum, such as \"grayromantic\" (romantic attraction rarely experienced or only weakly experienced) or \"demiromantic\" (only experiencing romantic attraction after a strong emotional bond has been formed with the target).[8][12] As the experience of romantic attraction is subjective, some aromantic people may find it difficult",

Subsets of the practice include \"sissy training\" and variations thereof, where the submissive male is \"trained\" to become feminine. Feminization as a sexual fetish is not the same thing as being a transgender woman, and the submissive partners engaging in it are typically cisgender men. It has been speculated that the fetish is rooted in societal pressure for men to be traditionally masculine.[4] Practice [edit] Feminization is a practice in dominance and submission or kink subcultures, which involves reversing gender roles, making a submissive partner – typically a man – take on a feminine role, often for humiliation-based sexual pleasure.[3][5] This may include them cross-dressing in feminine clothing such as lingerie, makeup, jewellery, perfume, acting in a feminine manner, getting referred to by a feminine name, having anal sex as the receptive partner,[3][4] wearing prosthetic breasts, or tucking.[6] People participating in feminization often role-play different scenarios based around the submissive partner\u0027s femininity or feminine clothes; these may include role-playing being caught in the act of trying on panties or lipstick, being discovered to be wearing frilly lingerie under their clothes, being a princess,[6] being a \"damsel in distress\" and treated like a helpless woman,[7] or being hired \"as a woman\" for a female-coded job like a nurse, cheerleader, sex worker, or businesswoman.[6] HuffPost described one dominatrix\u0027s sissification sessions as involving humiliating the submissive by \"parading them around\" in high heels, make-up, and lingerie; another dominatrix does her sessions by \"cheerleading\" men into exploring femininity.[5] Despite being labeled as \"forced\" feminization, as the role-played scenario may involve that the submissive partner supposedly is feminized against their will, it is a fantasy that is agreed upon by its participants.[4] Whereas not all participants are interested in BDSM aspects of the practice, and only enjoy dressing up, it may also include things such as spanking, pegging, bondage,[3] and humiliation such as making fun of the submissive for having a small and soft penis, and referring to it as a clitoris.[6] The feminized partner is sometimes called a \"sissy\",[3] and may be said to have been \"sissified\".[8] Sissy training and variations [edit] A woman applying makeup to a man during the feminization fetish. A subset of feminization is \"sissy training\", wherein the dominant partner slowly over time trains the submissive in being a sissy, making them take on \"ultra-feminine\" behaviors and participate in feminine activities.[9] As part of this, it is common for the sissy to cross-dress; to shave their body,[9] including their genitals; wear make-up; and wear women\u0027s underwear,[8] to appear more womanly. Activities in sissy training involve non-sexual ones, such as applying make-up or cleaning the house, as well as sexual ones.[9] A typical Sissy Maid example. A further subset is \"sissy maid training\",[9] a common scenario,[7][10] where the sissy takes on the role of a maid, taking care of housework or serving drinks and food at a party while behaving submissively and wearing an often frilly and revealing maid uniform,[9][10] such as a French maid or rubber maid dress. The dominant partner in a sissy maid training scenario, overseeing the sissy\u0027s housework, may role-play punishing them with things such as spanking, humiliation or bondage,[8] whether the infraction was real or made up;[6] a reward for good behavior might be allowing the submissive to orgasm.[11] Another common sub-set is \"slut training\", where the submissive partner is made to wear \"slutty\" feminine clothing[7] that may reveal a lot of bare skin and show off the submissive\u0027s curves,[12] whi",

For other uses, see Westerners (Korea), Western United States, and Western States Endurance Run. For other uses, see Western World (disambiguation) and Western Power (disambiguation). A map of the \"Western world\" based-on Samuel P. Huntington\u0027s 1996 Clash of Civilizations. Countries and territories that are generally considered as constituents of the Western world Countries which are either a part of the West or distinct civilizations intimately related to the West Non-western countries[1] The Western world, also known as the West, primarily refers to various nations and states in Western Europe,[a] Northern America, and Australasia;[b] with some debate as to whether those in Eastern Europe and Latin America[c] also constitute the West.[3][4] The Western world likewise is called the Occident (from Latin occidens \u0027setting down, sunset, west\u0027) in contrast to the Eastern world known as the Orient (from Latin oriens \u0027origin, sunrise, east\u0027). Definitions of the \"Western world\" vary according to context and perspectives; the West is an evolving concept made up of cultural, political, and economic synergy among diverse groups of people, and not a rigid region with fixed borders and members.[5] Some historians contend that a linear development of the West can be traced from Ancient Greece and Rome,[6] while others argue that such a projection constructs a false genealogy.[7][8] A geographical concept of the West started to take shape in the 4th century CE when Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor, divided the Roman Empire between the Greek East and Latin West. The East Roman Empire, later called the Byzantine Empire, continued for a millennium, while the West Roman Empire lasted for only about a century and a half. Significant theological and ecclesiastical differences led Western Europeans to consider the Christians in the Byzantine Empire as heretics. In 1054 CE, when the church in Rome excommunicated the patriarch of Byzantium, the politico-religious division between the Western church and Eastern church culminated in the Great Schism or the East–West Schism.[9] Even though friendly relations continued between the two parts of Christendom for some time, the crusades made the schism definitive with hostility.[10] The West during these crusades tried to capture trade routes to the East and failed, it instead discovered the Americas.[11] In the aftermath of the European colonization of the Americas, primarily involving Western European powers, an idea of the \"Western\" world, as an inheritor of Latin Christendom emerged.[12] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest reference to the term \"Western world\" was from 1586, found in the writings of William Warner.[13] The countries that are considered constituents of the West vary according to perspective rather than their geographical location. Countries like Australia and New Zealand, located in the Eastern Hemisphere are included in modern definitions of the Western world, as these regions and others like them have been significantly influenced by the British—derived from colonization, and immigration of Europeans—factors that grounded such countries to the West.[14] Depending on the context and the historical period in question, Russia was sometimes seen as a part of the West, and at other times juxtaposed with it, as well as endorsing anti-Western sentiment.[15][16][17] The United States became more prominently featured in the conceptualizations of the West as it rose as a great power, amidst the development of communication–transportation technologies like the telegraph and railroads \"shrinking\" the distance between both the Atlantic Ocean shores.[15] At some times between the 18th century and the mid-20th century, prominent countries in the West such as the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand have been envisioned by some as ethnocracies for Whites.[18][19][20] Racism is claimed as a contributing factor to Western European colonization of the New World, which today constitutes much of the geographical Western world and is split between Global North and Global South.[21][22] Starting from the late 1960s, certain parts of the Western world have become notable for their diversity due to immigration and changes in fertility rates.[23][24] The idea of \"the West\" over the course of time has evolved from a directional concept to a socio-political concept—temporalized and rendered as a concept of the future bestowed with notions of progress and modernity.[15] Introduction The origins of Western civilization can be traced back to the ancient Mediterranean world. Ancient Greece[d] and Ancient Rome[e] are generally considered to be the birthplaces of Western civilization—Greece having heavily influenced Rome—the former due to its impact on philosophy, democracy, science, aesthetics, as ",

It hosts user-submitted videos, which range in duration from three seconds to 60 minutes.[5] It can be accessed through a mobile app or through its website. Since its launch, TikTok has become one of the world\u0027s most popular social media platforms, using recommendation algorithms to connect content creators and influencers with new audiences.[6] In April 2020, TikTok surpassed two billion mobile downloads worldwide.[7] Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, surpassing Google.[8] The popularity of TikTok has allowed viral trends in food, fashion, and music to take off and increase the platform\u0027s cultural impact worldwide.[9][10] TikTok has come under scrutiny due to data privacy violations, mental health concerns, misinformation, offensive content, addictive algorithm, and its role during the Gaza war.[11][12][13] While TikTok remains accessible to users in most countries, a minority of countries (including India and Afghanistan) have implemented full or partial bans. Many other countries limit TikTok\u0027s use on government-issued devices for security or privacy reasons.[11][14] Corporate structure TikTok Ltd was incorporated in the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean and is based in both Singapore and Los Angeles.[15] It owns four entities which are based respectively in the United States, Australia (which also runs the New Zealand business), United Kingdom (also owns subsidiaries in the European Union), and Singapore (owns operations in Southeast Asia and India).[16][17] Its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, is owned by founders and Chinese investors, other global investors, and employees.[18] One of ByteDance\u0027s main domestic subsidiaries is owned by Chinese state funds and entities through a 1% golden share.[19][20][21] Employees have reported that multiple overlaps exist between TikTok and ByteDance in terms of personnel management and product development.[22][23][24][25] TikTok says that since 2020, its US-based CEO is responsible for making important decisions, and has downplayed its China connection.[25] History Douyin \"Douyin\" redirects here; not to be confused with doujin.

The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, stated that \"China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we don\u0027t expand on a global scale, we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four-fifths. So, going global is ",

It quickly became popular after the music video for the song was uploaded to YouTube on April 22, 2007, and has since been viewed more than 140 million times as of May 2025.[1] \"Chocolate Rain\" was ranked as the hottest viral video of summer 2007 by CTV and was awarded the 2008 YouTube Award in the category \"Music\".[2][3] Lyrically, the song is a metaphor for racism against African Americans.[4] Music video [edit] The official music video for \"Chocolate Rain,\" lasting 4 minutes and 52 seconds, was uploaded on April 23, 2007, to Tay Zonday\u0027s official YouTube channel. The video portrays Zonday in a recording studio wearing a white T-shirt and singing into a condenser microphone. Occasional cuts to Zonday playing a digital piano are also shown. From time to time, Zonday moves away from the microphone inbetween lines; an explanation is provided via a caption that appears early in the video – \"**I move away from the mic to breathe in\". The music video was ranked as the hottest viral video of summer 2007 by CTV.[5] The video has garnered 140 million views as of February 2025[update].[6] Critical reception [edit] Garth Montgomery of The Daily Telegraph described the song as having a \"hypnotic quality,\" with \"curious vocals that sound like a man much older than the young artist,\" playing over a \"cheesy\" drum loop.[7] During a brief interview on The Opie and Anthony Show, Zonday called the song \"cheesy\" and commented how its lyrics dealt with racism.[8] The initial spread of the popularity of the song was due to 4chan.[9] Zonday said, \"I\u0027m pretty sure the \u0027Chocolate Rain\u0027 attention started as a joke at 4chan.org, an internet forum that is credited with starting lots of popular internet phenomena. It spread to a general audience and people started uploading spoofs. I don\u0027t know what causes people to listen to my music. If I could speak it, there would be no reason to write songs.\"[10] Performances [edit] Clips of the video have been played or referenced on television and radio shows, including G4TV\u0027s Attack of the Show,[11] Last Call with Carson Daly, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Maury and Online Nation. On August 9, 2007, Zonday performed the song on the late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! as part of its \"Internet Talent Showcase\".[12] It has also been performed live on the BBC Radio 1 Chris Moyles Show.[13] Later, Zonday came out on Lily Allen and Friends, where he sang in a live performance of Lily Allen\u0027s song \"Smile\". Zonday performed Chocolate Rain during the autism education benefit Night of Too Many Stars on October 2, 2010. During some 2007 and 2008 performances, LeRoi Moore, the saxophonist for the Dave Matthews Band, integrated the melody into an outro on the band\u0027s song \"The Dreaming Tree\".[6][5][7] Zonday also got a \"Web Redemption\" on Daniel Tosh\u0027s show Tosh.0. Spoofs and tributes [edit] \"Chocolate Rain\" is the subject of numerous parodies, tributes, remixes, and covers on the Internet. Major musical artists such as John Mayer[14] and Green Day drummer Tre Cool[15][16] have spoofed the song on TV and YouTube. Zonday himself appeared on the August 2007 episode of VH1\u0027s Best Week Ever and performed a parody called \"Summer Break\".[17] In March 2008, Zonday performed the song during YouTube Live; during the same show, Bo Burnham (with his song \"Welcome to YouTube\") made a comical reference to the song, with the lyrics \"Your favourite coat\u0027s got a doo-doo stain, I pray to God that\u0027s Chocolate Rain.\" Zonday was featured in the music video for rock band Weezer\u0027s song \"Pork and Beans\" and appeared in a YouTube video with Weezer\u0027s Brian Bell to play an acoustic version of \"Pork and Beans\" on June 3, 2008.[18] Zonday himself appeared as a guest voice on an episode of Robot Chicken, where the song was spoofed as \"Chocolate Grain\".[19] The song was part of the mashup \"Like Tears In Chocolate Rain\" from Neil Cicierega\u0027s Mouth Sounds. On April 2, 2008, South Park aired \"Canada on Strike\", in which Zonday appears talking about \"Chocolate Rain\" (along with other Internet memes), only to be killed when a stare from the Dramatic Look Gopher makes his head explode. The title of the hit was humorously manipulated in the phrase \"get ready for some chocolate pain\" within the episode. The episode brought back the video\u0027s popularity and boosted its views by over one million in the days following its airing. In The Office episode \"Business Ethics,\" Michael Scott confesses that when he discovered YouTube, he \"watched Cookie Monster sings \u0027Chocolate Rain\u0027 about a thousand times\".

Vice News was known for broadcasting news programs on HBO; including the Emmy-winning[12] weekly self-titled documentary series, which premiered in April 2013, and features segments on global issues hosted by co-founders Smith and Alvi, and a rotating cast of correspondents.[13][14] A spin-off, Vice News Tonight, premiered 10 October 2016 and showcased a nightly roundup of global news, technology, the environment, economics, and pop culture while eschewing traditional news anchors.[15][16][17] On 10 June 2019, HBO announced Vice News Tonight\u0027s cancellation, in addition to ending relations with Vice Media, after a seven-year partnership.[18] In August 2019, it was reported that the company was laying off staff as part of a shift towards news that would involve merging Viceland and Vice News.[19] In April 2023, it was announced that Vice Media was restructuring and downsizing its news division.[20][21][22] A month later, Vice filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy[23] and agreed to be acquired by a consortium led by Fortress Investment Group for $350 million in June.[24] In February 2024, CEO Bruce Dixon announced additional layoffs and that Vice.com would cease publishing content.[25][26] In July 2025, Vice published new content.[27] Vice has since partnered with other media companies, such as Savage Ventures, to distribute its content.[28] History [edit] Founding and early years (1994–2005) [edit] Voice (later Voices of Montreal) was founded by Alix Laurent of Interimages Communications in October 1994, with Suroosh Alvi as editor and Gavin McInnes as assistant editor, with Shane Smith joining the magazine\u0027s staff later.[29][10][30][31][32] The magazine focused on Montreal\u0027s alternative cultural scene, to compete with the already established Montreal Mirror. Alvi, McInnes and Smith bought out the publisher and changed the magazine\u0027s name to Vice in 1996.[33][30] As the magazine became more successful, the company received an investment of $4 million by Canadian investor Richard Szalwinski and Vice relocated to New York City in 1999. In 2001, the co-founders bought Vice back and moved to new offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.[34][35] Digital expansion (2006–2011) [edit] In 2006, on the advice of creative director Spike Jonze, Vice began expanding into digital video, launching new video service VBS.tv as a joint venture with MTV Networks.[36][31] VBS gained a fan base with shows like The Vice Guide To Travel, Epicly Later\u0027d, Toxic and Hamilton\u0027s Pharmacopeia.[37] In 2007, Vice Media began expanding its digital video operation, launching new channels, such as Motherboard (tech), Noisey (music), and The Creators Project, an arts/technology site founded in partnership with Intel. Vice Media would later launch sites around electronic music culture (Thump), global news (Vice News), food (Munchies) and sports (Vice Sports). Additionally, Vice Media launched Virtue Worldwide, a creative services agency, to expand their capabilities for work around their platforms.[38] During this time, Santiago Stelley was the director of content of VBS.tv (2006–2010) and creative director of Vice Media ",

Hidden away in the rural Catskills, Casa Susanna provided privacy to its guests, in a time when public cross-dressing was a criminal offense across most of America.[5] However, guests occasionally visited the town of Hunter to shop, where they were met by a range of reactions. Some were negative, but many locals saw them as reliable customers.[5] Casa Susanna was a haven for its guests to celebrate their \"inner girl\" without persecution, and acted as an important space within which guests were allowed to comfortably and happily participate in activities such as gardening and board games whilst expressing their gender identity or inner desire to cross-dress.[6] Most guests at Casa Susanna were married, and considered themselves heterosexual men who enjoyed cross-dressing, but many others later identified as transgender and lived out their lives as women, including Virginia Prince and Susanna herself.[1] Casa Susanna also offered photography, having appointed one of their guests, Andrea Susan, as their official photographer. In doing so, the Valentis avoided the possibility of sending the negatives to a professional developer who might later call the police, and allowed for affirming photographs of their guests to be taken as a souvenir and as a source of affirmation for their gender expression. Andrea took many photographs of her fellow guests and developed them at home;[7] though Polaroid cameras were available at the time, Andrea used a film camera that required the use of negatives instead, and put the negatives in the possession of her photography mentor Dick, who had gifted her her photography equipment. However, when Dick later married, these negatives were thrown away, eventually making their way to a Manhattan flea market in the mid-2000s. There, they were found by Robert Swope, \"a gentle punk rocker turned furniture dealer\", who bought every photograph he could find and published them in a book with his partner Michel Hurst.[7] The release of the book Casa Susanna, fifty years after many of the photographs themselves were taken, led to many former attendees of Casa Susanna coming forward to share their experiences, allowing Casa Susanna to be documented.[8] Influence [edit] The book Casa Susanna, based on a collection of photographs from the site, inspired the Tony-nominated play Casa Valentina by Harvey Fierstein.[9] Casa Susanna, a documentary film by Sébastien Lifshitz, debuted at the 79th Venice International Film Festival.[10] From July 21, 2025 to January 25, 2026, the Metropolitan Museum of Art displayed Casa Susanna, an exhibition of photographs and publications by and for the community. The exhibit was organized by the Art Gallery of Ontario and Les Rencontres d’Arles.[11] See also [edit] Gay villages List of gay villages References [edit] ^ a b c \"Google Maps\".

Prostitution is sometimes described as sexual services, commercial sex or, colloquially, hooking. It is also described as gender-based violence.[4] It is sometimes referred to euphemistically as \"the world\u0027s oldest profession\" in the English-speaking world.[5][6] A person who works in the field is usually called a prostitute or sex worker, but other words, such as hooker and whore, are sometimes used pejoratively to refer to those who work in prostitution. The majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients.[7][8] Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms, and its legal status varies from country to country (sometimes from region to region within a given country). In most cases, it can be either an enforced crime, an unenforced crime, a decriminalized activity, a legal but unregulated activity, or a regulated profession. It is one branch of the sex industry, along with pornography, stripping, and erotic dancing. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the client\u0027s residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort\u0027s residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call). Another form is street prostitution. According to a 2011 report by Fondation Scelles there are about 42 million prostitutes in the world, living all over the world (though most of Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa lack data, studied countries in that large region rank as top sex tourism destinations).[9] Estimates place the annual revenue generated by prostitution worldwide to be over $100 billion.[10] The position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions. Some view prostitution as a form of exploitation of or violence against women,[11] and children,[12] that helps to create a supply of victims for human trafficking.[13][14] Some critics of prostitution as an institution are supporters of the \"Nordic model\" that decriminalizes the act of selling sex and makes the purchase of sex illegal. This approach has also been adopted by Canada, Iceland, Ireland,[15] Northern Ireland, Norway, France and Sweden. Others view sex work as a legitimate occupation, whereby a person trades or exchanges sexual acts for money. Amnesty International is one of the notable groups calling for the decriminalization of prostitution.[16] Etymology and terminology General Prostitute c. 1890. Prostitute is derived from the Latin prostituta. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of \"pro\" meaning \"up front\" or \"forward\" and \"stituere\", defined as \"to offer up for sale\".[17] Another explanation is that prostituta is a composition of pro and statuere (to cause to stand, to station, place erect). A literal translation therefore is: \"to put up front fo",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Rosebud pornography) Protrusion of the walls of the rectum outside the body Medical condition Rectal prolapse Other names Complete rectal prolapse, external rectal prolapse A. full thickness external rectal prolapse, and B. mucosal prolapse. Note circumferential arrangement of folds in full thickness prolapse compared to radial folds in mucosal prolapse.[1] Specialty General surgery A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body.[2] However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.[3][4] Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.[5] Rectal prolapse is generally diagnosed more commonly in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and any sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated.[5] Most external prolapse cases can be treated successfully, often with a surgical procedure. Internal prolapses are traditionally harder to treat and surgery may not be suitable for many patients. Classification [edit] A. Internal rectal intussusception. B. External (complete) rectal prolapse The different kinds of rectal prolapse can be difficult to grasp, as different definitions are used and some recognize certain subtypes and not others do not. Essentially, rectal prolapses may be: full thickness (complete), where all the layers of the rectal wall prolapse, or involve the mucosal layer only (partial) external if they protrude from the anus and are visible externally, or internal if they do not circumferential, where the whole circumference of the rectal wall prolapses, or segmental if only parts of the circumference of the rectal wall prolapse present at rest, or occurring during straining. External (complete) rectal prolapse (rectal procidentia, full thickness rectal prolapse, overt rectal prolapse[6]) is a full thickness, circumferential, true intussusception of the rectal wall which protrudes from the anus and is visible externally.[7][8] Internal rectal intussusception (occult rectal prolapse, internal procidentia) can be defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the upper rectal (or lower sigmoid) wall that can occur during defecation.[9] This infolding is perhaps best visualised as folding a sock inside out,[10] creating \"a tube within a tube\".[11] Another definition is \"where the rectum collapses but does not exit the anus\".[12] Many sources differentiate between internal rectal intussusception and mucosal prolapse, implying that the former is a full thickness prolapse of rectal wall. However, a publication by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons stated that internal rectal intussusception involved the mucosal and submucosal layers separating from the underlying muscularis mucosa layer attachments, resulting in the separated portion of rectal lining \"sliding\" down.[5] This may signify that authors use the terms internal rectal prolapse and internal mucosal prolapse to describe the same phenomena. Mucosal prolapse (partial rectal mucosal prolapse)[13] refers to prolapse of the loosening of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal layer of the rectal wall. Most sources define mucosal prolapse as an external, segmental prolapse which is easily confused with prolapsed (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids (piles).[10] However, both internal mucosal prolapse (see below) and circumferential mucosal prolapse are described by some.[13] Others do not consider mucosal prolapse a true form of rectal prolapse.[14] Internal mucosal prolapse (rectal internal mucosal prolapse, RIMP) refers to prolapse of the mucosal layer of the rectal wall which does not protrude externally. There is some controversy surrounding this condition as to its relationship with hemorrhoidal disease, or whether it is a separate entity.[15] The term \"mucosal hemorrhoidal prolapse\" is also used.[16] Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS, solitary rectal ulcer, SRU) occurs with internal rectal intussusception and is part of the spectrum of rectal prolapse conditions.[5] It describes ulceration of the rectal lining caused by repeated frictional damage as the internal intussusception is forced into the anal canal during straining. SRUS can be considered a consequence of internal intussusception, which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases. Mucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) is recognized by some. It includes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps.[17][18] It is c",

In the study of sexual orientation, some researchers distinguish environmental influences from hormonal influences,[1] while other researchers include biological influences such as prenatal hormones as part of environmental influences.[2] Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is the result of a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.[1][3][4] They do not view sexual orientation as a choice.[1][3][5] Evidence for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation is weak, especially for males.[6] There is no substantial evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences influence sexual orientation,[7][8] but research has linked childhood gender nonconformity and homosexuality.

Fucking Trans Women Cover of issue #0 Author Mira Bellwether Illustrator Bellwether Cover artist Bellwether Language English Publisher Self-published Publication date October 2010 (digital) August 2013 (print) Publication place United States Media type Zine Pages 80 ISBN 9781492128939 (print edition) Website Official website Fucking Trans Women (FTW) is a zine created by Mira Bellwether. A single 80-page issue, numbered \"#0\", was published in October 2010 and republished in 2013 as Fucking Trans Women: A Zine About the Sex Lives of Trans Women; further issues were planned, but none had been published as of Bellwether\u0027s death in December 2022[update]. Bellwether wrote all of the issue\u0027s articles, which explore a variety of sexual activities involving trans women,[a] primarily ones who are pre-op or non-op with respect to bottom surgery. Fucking Trans Women was the first publication of note to focus on sex with trans women and was innovative in its focus on trans women\u0027s own perspectives and its inclusion of instructions for many of the sex acts depicted.[1] Emphasizing sex acts possible with flaccid penises or not involving penises at all, it coined the term muffing to refer to stimulation of the inguinal canals, an act it popularized. The zine has received both popular-culture and scholarly attention, and was described in Sexuality \u0026 Culture as \"a comprehensive guide to trans women\u0027s sexuality\"[2] and in Playboy as \"widely considered\" the \"most in-depth guide to having sex with pre- and non-op trans femme bodies\".[3] Background [edit] Mira Bellwether,[b] a self-described \"trans dyke\"[4] then living in the U.S. state of Iowa,[c] created the zine over the course of \"a year or so\".[7] She was inspired partly by the 1970s–1980s magazine Drag and what she described as \"a spirit of sisterhood and cooperation between drag queens, transsexuals, and crossdressers manifested in articles that talked about our commonalities and shared experiences as well as our shared political struggles across communities\".[8] She intended to publish a zine featuring submissions from others, but found the material insufficient; she instead chose to make the zine a solo effort and number it \"#0\" to leave room for a \"#1\" featuring others\u0027 contributions.[9] In an interview with Kennedy Nadler of Autostraddle in 2013, she wrote that she \"wanted to speak to aspects of our sexuality that are almost never given any attention in media whatsoever: those of us who enjoy sex with other women, trans and otherwise, and some of the difficulties (as well as unique pleasures) of trans women having sex with cis women\".[10] Fucking Trans Women #0 was published online in October 2010,[10] billed as an \"80-Page Giant\".[11] Bellwether republished it in print through CreateSpace in August 2013,[12] without the \"#0\" and with the subtitle A Zine About the Sex Lives of Trans Women.[13] Design [edit] The zine\u0027s cover depicts a woman in a leotard (with prominent crotch bulge) and open jacket holding a whip. At her feet, indistinct figures run around in a ring.[5] Rachel Stevens and Megan Purdy of WomenWriteAboutComics characterized the design as \"intentionally messy\".[14] The zine is black and white, with articles overlaid on grayscale images of nude or erotically-posed women.[14] For many of the acts Bellwether depicted, no scientific diagrams existed, and so she illustrated them herself,[15] an innovative approach for the time.[16] Content [edit] \"Muffing\" redirects here. For a definition of that term, see the Wiktionary entry muffing. For other uses, see Muff (disambiguation). \"I think one of the ideas in FTW that I\u0027m the most proud of is that the penis can be an organ for receiving pleasure in any state.\" Bellwether, interview in Autostraddle[10] Rather than set a cohesive narrative, Bellwether focused on trans women\u0027s[a] physical experiences.[17] She highlighted both how trans women\u0027s bodies differ from cis men\u0027s[18] and how they are similar to cis women\u0027s bodies, such as the structures of the penis and clitoris respectively.[19] Bellwether had a penis and therefore focused on the perspective of pre-op and non-op trans women (those who have not had bottom surgery).[18] She emphasized sex acts possible with flaccid (\u0027soft\u0027) penises,[20] associating feminizing hormone therapy–induced erectile dysfunction with pleasure rather than with a lack of sexual satisfaction.[21] She criticized the focus of \"almost all sexual discourse on penises\" being \"on erect penises, hard penises, penetrating penises\".[22] She also explained how trans women with penises can use strap-on dildos, which may be more pleasurable and allows trans women to decide the",

For the fictional cat from Fairy Tail, see Happy (manga character). A 2010 lolcat meme using the grammatically incorrect \"I are ...\" format, and employing misspellings for humorous effect A lolcat (pronounced /ˈlɒlkæt/ LOL-kat), or LOLcat, is an image macro of one or more cats. Lolcat images\u0027 idiosyncratic and intentionally grammatically incorrect text is known as lolspeak.[1] Lolcat is a compound word of the acronymic abbreviation LOL (laughing out loud) and the word \"cat\".[2][3] A synonym for lolcat is cat macro or cat meme, since the images are a type of image macro and also a well-known genre of Internet meme.[4] Lolcats are commonly designed for photo sharing imageboards and other Internet forums. History [edit] A Brighton Cats carte de visite by Harry Pointer, c. 1870s British portrait photographer Harry Pointer created a carte de visite series featuring cats posed in various situations in the early 1870s. To these he usually added amusing text intended to further enhance their appeal.[5] These souvenir cards were known as Brighton Cats. Other early figures include Harry Whittier Frees and (using taxidermied animals) Walter Potter.[6] The first recorded use of the term \"lolcat\" was used on 4chan, an anonymous imageboard.[7][8][9] The word \"Lolcat\" was in use as early as June 2006; the domain name lolcats.com was registered on June 14, 2006.[10] Their popularity was spread through usage on forums such as Something Awful.[11] The News Journal states that \"some trace the lolcats back to the site 4chan, which features bizarre cat pictures on Saturdays, or \u0027Caturdays\u0027.\" Ikenburg adds that the images have been \"slinking around the Internet for years under various labels, but they did not become a sensation until early 2007 with the advent of I Can Has Cheezburger? \"[12] The first image on \"I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER?\" was posted on January 11, 2007, and was allegedly from the Something Awful website.\"[13][14] Lev Grossman of Time wrote that the oldest known example \"probably dates to 2006\",[15] but later corrected himself in a blog post[16] where he recanted his statement based on the anecdotal evidence readers had sent him, placing the origin of \"Caturday\" and many of the images now known by a few as \"lolcats\" in early 2005. The domain name \"caturday.com\" was registered on April 30, 2005.[17] The term lolcat gained national media attention in the United States when it was covered by Time, which wrote that non-commercialized phenomena of the sort are increasingly rare, stating that lolcats have \"a distinctly old-school, early 1990s, Usenet feel to [them]\".[18] Entertainment Weekly put them on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Da cutest distractshun of da decaid?

We can neber haz enuf of deez capshioned pics of cuddlie kittehs.\"[19] \"Lolcat\" was also a runner-up under the \"Most Creative\" category under the American Dialect Society Word of the Year Awards, losing out to \"Googlegänger\".[20] Format [edit] A lolcat image on the icanhascheezburger.com website in 2007[21] Lolcat is a compound word made from the acronym \"LOL\" and \"cat\". Lolcat images comprise a photo of a cat with a large caption characteristically superimposed onto the image in a heavy, sans-serif font such as Impact or Arial Black.[22] Such images and memes following the format are often digitally edited for comedic effect. Captions act as a speech balloon encompassing a comment from the cat, or as a description of the depicted scene. The caption is intentionally written with deviations from standard English spelling and grammar,[22] featuring \"strangely-conjugated verbs, but a tendency to converge to a new set of rules in spelling and grammar\".[22][23][24][failed verification] The text parodies the grammar-poor patois stereotypically attributed to Internet slang. Frequently, lolcat captions take the form of phrasal templates.[24] Some phrases have a known source, usually a well-known Internet meme, such as All your base are belong to us or Do not want,[25] while others don\u0027t. The language of lolcats has also been likened to baby talk,[26] however it draws on a variety of linguistic resources, not just the imitation of baby talk.[27] Common themes include jokes of the form \"Im in ur [noun], [verb]-ing ur [related noun].\"[28] Many lolcat images capture cats performing characteristically human actions or appearing to use modern technology, such as computers.[citation needed] There are several well-known Lolcat images and single-word captions that have spawned many variations and imitations, including \"Ceiling Cat\" (see below). Others include Fail (a cat with a slice of processed cheese on its face)[29] and \"I Can Has Cheezburger\" (a portrait of a blue British Shorthair).[30] Another popular format is \"[Adjective] cat is [adjective/noun].\" Recurring characters [edit] \"Ceiling Cat\" is a character s",

This is experienced by people who identify as transgender or transsexual, and often results in gender dysphoria.[1] The causes of gender incongruence have been studied for decades. Transgender brain studies, especially those on trans women attracted to women (gynephilic), and those on trans men attracted to men (androphilic), are limited, as they include only a small number of tested individuals.[2] Twin studies indicate that genes play a role in gender incongruence, although the precise genes involved are not known or well understood.[3][4][5] Environmental factors, such as prenatal hormone exposure, have also been investigated but are difficult to test.[5] Genetics Gender identity is genetically heritable, but no convincing candidate genes are known.[6][7] Gender incongruence has been associated with certain alleles relevant to steroidogenesis.[8] In 2013, a twin study combined a survey of pairs of twins where one or both had undergone, or had plans and medical approval to undergo, gender transition, with a literature review of published reports of transgender twins. The study found that one third of identical twin pairs in the sample were both transgender: 13 of 39 (33%) monozygotic or identical pairs of assigned males and 8 of 35 (22.8%) pairs of assigned females. Among dizygotic or genetically non-identical twin pairs, there was only 1 of 38 (2.6%) pairs where both twins were trans.[9] The significant percentage of identical twin pairs in which both twins are trans and the virtual absence of dizygotic twins (raised in the same family at the same time) in which both were trans would provide evidence that transgender identity is significantly influenced by genetics if both sets were raise",

This includes some characters listed on the list of animated series with LGBTQ characters page, drag queens, drag kings, tomboys, janegirls and others who cross-dress. Cross-dressing generally runs counter to established gender norms and can be seen as a form of transgender behavior but it doesn\u0027t always indicate such an identity, even though popular media often \"lump cross-dressing and homosexuality together.\"[1] There is also the phenomenon of \"situational cross-dressing\" where heterosexual characters cross-dress as a plot device or \"other non-gender-expressive reasons,\" especially superheroes and supervillains.[2][3] Harry Benshoff and Sean Griffin write that animation has always \"hint[ed] at the performative nature of gender\" such as when Bugs Bunny puts on a wig and a dress, he is a rabbit in drag as a human male who is in drag as a female.[4] This was preceded by cross-dressing in motion pictures began in the early days of the silent films. For instance, Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy occasionally dressed as women in their films.[citation needed] Even the beefy American actor Wallace Beery appeared in a series of silent films as a Swedish woman. The Three Stooges, especially Curly (Jerry Howard), sometimes appeared in drag in their short films. The tradition has continued for many years, usually played for laughs. Only in recent decades have there been dramatic films in which cross-dressing was included, possibly because of strict censorship of American films until the mid-1960s. The names are organized alphabetically by surname (i.e. last name), or by single name if the character does not have a surname. If more than two characters are in one entry, the last name of the first character is used.

For other uses, see Porn (disambiguation) and Pornography (disambiguation). XXX rating denotes pornography Pornography (colloquially called porn or porno) is sexually suggestive material, such as a picture, video, text, or audio, intended for sexual arousal.[a] Made for consumption by adults, pornographic depictions have evolved from cave paintings, some forty millennia ago, to modern-day virtual reality presentations. A general distinction of adults-only sexual content is made, classifying it as pornography or erotica. The oldest artifacts considered pornographic were discovered in Germany in 2008 and are dated to be at least 35,000 years old.[b] Human enchantment with sexual imagery representations has been a constant throughout history. However, the reception of such imagery varied according to the historical, cultural, and national contexts. The Indian Sanskrit text Kama Sutra (3rd century CE) contained prose, poetry, and illustrations regarding sexual behavior, and the book was celebrated; while the British English text Fanny Hill (1748), considered \"the first original English prose pornography,\" has been one of the most prosecuted and banned books. In the late 19th century, a film by Thomas Edison that depicted a kiss was denounced as obscene in the United States, whereas Eugène Pirou\u0027s 1896 film Bedtime for the Bride was received very favorably in France. Starting from the mid-twentieth century on, societal attitudes towards sexuality became lenient in the Western world where legal definitions of obscenity were made limited. In 1969, Blue Movie by Andy Warhol became the first film to depict unsimulated sex that received a wide theatrical release in the United States. This was followed by the \"Golden Age of Porn\" (1969–1984). The introduction of home video and the World Wide Web in the late 20th century led to global growth in the pornography business. Beginning in the 21st century, greater access to the Internet and affordable smartphones made pornography more mainstream. Pornography has been vouched to provision a safe outlet for sexual desires that may not be satisfied within relationships and be a facilitator of sexual fulfillment in people who do not have a partner. Pornography consumption is found to induce psychological moods and emotions similar to those evoked during sexual intercourse and casual sex. Pornography usage is considered a widespread recreational activity in-line with other digitally mediated activities such as use of social media or video games.[c] People who regard porn as sex education material were identified as more likely not to use condoms in their own sex life, thereby assuming a higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs); performers working for pornographic studios undergo regular testing for STIs unlike much of the general public. Comparative studies indicate higher tolerance and consumption of pornography among adults tends to be associated with their greater support for gender equality. Among feminist groups, some seek to abolish pornography believing it to be harmful, while others oppose censorship efforts insisting it is benign. A longitudinal study ascertained pornography use is not a predictive factor in intimate partner violence.[d] Porn Studies, started in 2014, is the first international peer-reviewed, academic journal dedicated to critical study of pornographic \"products and services\". Pornography is a major influencer of people\u0027s perception of sex in the digital age; a few pornographic websites rank among the top 50 most visited websites worldwide. Called an \"erotic engine\", pornography has been noted for its key role in the development of various communication and media processing technologies. For being an early adopter of innovations and a provider of financial capital, the pornography industry has been cited to be a contributing factor in the adoption and popularization of media related technologies. The exact economic size of the porn industry in the early twenty-first century is unknown. In 2023, estimates of the total market value stood at over US$172 billion. The legality of pornography varies across countries. People hold diverse views on the availability of pornography. From the mid-2010s, unscrupulous pornography such as deepfake pornography and revenge porn have become issues of concern. Etymology and definition The word pornography is a conglomerate of two ancient Greek words: πόρνος (pórnos) \"fornicators\", and γράφειν (gráphein) \"writing, recording, or description\".[1] In Greek language, the term pornography connotes depiction of sexual activity;[2] no date is known for the first use of the term pornography, the earliest attested, most related word found is πορνογράφος (pornographos) i.e. \"someone writing about harlots\" in the 3rd century CE work Deipnosophists by Athenaeus.[3][4] The oldest published reference to",

However, there are exceptions to the rule. Censors have been more lenient about the word in films that portray historical events. The ratings system is voluntary and there is no legal requirement that filmmakers submit every film.

For other uses, see HIV (disambiguation). \"AIDS virus\" redirects here. For the computer virus, see AIDS (computer virus). Human immunodeficiency viruses Scanning electron micrograph of HIV-1 (in green) budding from cultured lymphocyte. Multiple round bumps on cell surface represent sites of assembly and budding of virions.

Over time, they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),[1][2] a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive.[3] Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4] In most cases, HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids.[5][6] Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid, and through breast milk.[7][8][9][10] Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. Research has shown (for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples) that HIV is not contagious during sexual intercourse without a condom if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load.[5][6] HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system, such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells.[11] HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells,[12] apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells,[13] direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells.[14] When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of AIDS. Virology Classification See also: Subtypes of HIV HIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus,[15] part of the family Retroviridae.[16] Lentiviruses have many morphologies and biological properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[17] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, integrase, and host co-factors.[18] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system, for an indeterminate amount of time.[19] The virus can remain dormant in the human body for up to ten years after primary infection; during this period the virus does not cause symptoms. Alternatively, the integrated viral DNA may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins, using host cell resources, that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that will begin the replication cycle anew. Two types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was initially discovered and termed both lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) and human T-lymphotropic virus 3 (HTLV-III). HIV-1 is more virulent and more infective than HIV-2,[20] and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2, compared to HIV-1, implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Due to its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.[21] Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 have gained an additional classification according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, with the change being approved in 2020, to belong to the species called \"Lentivirus humimdef1",

In her definition of transmisogyny, Serano does not limit those affected by transmisogyny to individuals who identify as transgender and includes others, such as cisgender people, and those who identify as drag queens.[7] Framework [edit] The concept of transmisogyny hinges on two other concepts first described by Serano: traditional sexism and oppositional sexism. The former is the idea that \"maleness and masculinity are superior to femaleness and femininity\", while the latter holds male and female as \"rigid, mutually exclusive categories\". Transmisogyny stems from both these concepts.[2] In Whipping Girl, Julia Serano writes that the existence of trans women is seen as a threat to a \"male-centered gender hierarchy\".[8]: 15  Gender theorist Judith Butler echoes this assumption, stating that the murder of transgender women by men is \"the most toxic form that masculinity can take\", a way for the killer to assert power over the victim in the instant, in response to the idea of the intrinsic nature of his ",

Femboy can be used as both a sexual and non-sexual term; it does not denote a specific sexual orientation or gender role. The term originated in the 1990s. It has since been popularised through internet forums and social media, starting on 4chan and expanding to other sites such as Reddit and TikTok, where hashtag trends such as \"#femboyfriday\" have received attention in the media. In gender studies, the term has also been used as an identifier for individuals on the transgender spectrum; in porn studies, the term has been seen as an identifier for a submissive role in intercourse and as exhibiting elements of sexual fantasy. Usage Etymology According to Dictionary.com, the term femboy originated at least in the 1990s. It is a compound noun from the words fem (an abbreviation of feminine and femme) and boy.[1][2] However, one early usage can be found in the 1981 release of the Abbreviations Dictionary by editor and photographer Ralph De Sola.[3] The variant femboi uses the LGBTQ term boi.[1] By 2000, the term boi[4] had come to denote \"a young, attractive gay man\". The term \"boi\" has also been used, independently of any meaning related to sexuality, as an alternate spelling for boy.[5] Definitions Collins English Dictionary defines femboy as \"a male whose appearance and behavioural traits are regarded as conventionally feminine\".[6] According to Dictionary.com, t",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Mormon premarital sex avoidance method Illustration of \"soaking\" or the act of vaginal penetration without subsequent thrusting Soaking is a sexual practice of inserting the penis into the vagina but not subsequently thrusting or ejaculating, reportedly used by some Mormons, also known as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).[5] Soaking is purportedly used as a loophole to the LDS Church\u0027s strict rules against extramarital sex, though the LDS Church does not support this view, instead teaching that \"it is wrong to touch the private [...] parts of another person\u0027s body\" outside of marriage.[6] There is no evidence that soaking is a common practice. Some Latter-day Saints have said that soaking is only an urban legend,[1][7] while others give firsthand accounts of having practiced it themselves.[8][9][10] Background [edit] See also: Sexuality and the LDS Church Sexual activity before and outside of a monogamous, heterosexual marriage is strictly forbidden by Mormon teachings. This includes masturbation.[11][12][13] These teachings began with Mormonism\u0027s founder Joseph Smith and are contained in The Book of Mormon.[14] A 2002 US survey found LDS teens had the highest rates of any religious group that reported their parents would be \"extremely mad\" if they had premarital sex (78%).[15]: 87  Despite the prohibition, a study by LDS church university sociologists published in 1992 found that nearly 60% of 1,000 Mormon teen women surveyed reported having had sex before marriage,[16][17][18] and a smaller survey of 158 married Mormon women in 1995 found that 32% reported having premarital sex.[19] Postings on TikTok and other social media sites have stated that soaking serves as a purported loophole to the LDS Church\u0027s sexual code of conduct, called the law of chastity, which says that all sexual activity outside of a heterosexual marriage is a sin.[2][20][21] The term soaking comes from the idea that vaginal lubrication is \"soaking\" the penis.[22] The LDS Church does not believe soaking is a loophole to the church\u0027s code of sexual conduct,[23] as it teaches that \"it is wrong to touch the private [...] parts of another person\u0027s body even if clothed\" outside of a monogamous heterosexual marriage.[6][24][9] At church-run schools like Brigham Young University, students who confess to or are reported for having pre- or extra-marital sex can be expelled because of the universities\u0027 codes of conduct.[25] Prevalence [edit] Some Latter-day Saints have said that soaking is only an urban legend,[1][7] while others on social media report knowing church members who had soaked,[29] or give firsthand accounts of trying the practice with a partner before marriage while a member of the LDS Church.[8][9][10] One church member stated it was difficult to know how common soaking was among Mormon youth due to the secrecy and shame around sex in the LDS Church,[2] and underreporting due to the social-desirability bias is a common issue even among anonymous surveys of many stigmatized sexual behaviors.[30][31] In popular culture [edit] See also: Latter Day Saints in popular culture In 2021, a video about soaking went viral on TikTok,[33] and since then the topic has an estimated 69 million posts and 243 million mentions on the platform as of 2024.[22][34][35] It has been used as a plot point in sitcoms in the early 2020s,[2][36] such as the television series Alpha House,[36] Get Shorty,[37][38] and Jury Duty.[39][40] The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City cast member Heather Gay reported having soaked, but did not believe jump humping (inviting a third person to generate bed motion for the soakers) was an actual practice.[10][22] It was also referenced in the book Up Up, Down Down,[41] in a Barstool Sports video segment,[4][42] a Make Some Noise improv sketch,[43] and in at least one short film of Mormon pornography.[44] Comedian Chelsea Handler explained the practice in an interview on The Late Late Show with James Corden.[45] A hot tub company\u0027s Utah billboard that said \"we love soaking too\" was reported to have been removed after six days due to its controversial nature.[46] Comedian Shane Gillis referenced the practice by Mormons in a Saturday Night Live sketch.[47] Reactions [edit] Two satirical social media accounts, the BYU Virginity Club[48] and the BYU Slut Club,[49] have both disavowed the practice.[50][8] Articles have stated that soaking does not prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infection and may still result in pregnancy.[3][22] One interviewee stated it was \"a dangerous form of misinformation being used to manipulate naive girls in college dorms.\"[51] Related practices [edit] Practices related to soaking include jump humping, provo pushing, and durfing: Jump humping – Soaking is sometimes accompanied by \"jump humping\", in which a third person is invited to bounce on the bed (or to push up on the mattress from below) for a couple",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sociological constructs related to sex For the grammatical concept, see Grammatical gender. For other uses, see Gender (disambiguation). Gender symbols intertwined: the red Venus symbol (female) and the blue Mars symbol (male) Gender is the range of social, psychological, cultural, and behavioral aspects of being a man (or boy), woman (or girl), or third gender.[1][2] Although gender often corresponds to sex, a transgender person may identify with a gender other than their sex assigned at birth. Most cultures use a gender binary, in which gender is divided into two categories, and people are considered part of one or the other;[3][4][5] those who are outside these groups may fall under the umbrella term non-binary. Some societies have third genders (and fourth genders, etc.) such as the hijras of South Asia and two-spirit persons native to North America. Most scholars agree that gender is a central characteristic for social organization;[6] this may include social constructs (i.e. gender roles) as well as gender expression.[7][8][9] The word has been used as a synonym for sex, and the balance between these usages has shifted over time.[10][11][12] In the mid-20th century, a terminological distinction in modern English (known as the sex and gender distinction) between biological sex and gender began to develop in the academic areas of psychology, sociology, sexology, and feminism.[13][14] Before the mid-20th century, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories.[7][1] In the West, in the 1970s, feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. The distinction between gender and sex is made by most contemporary social scientists in Western countries,[15][16][17] behavioral scientists and biologists,[18] many legal systems and government bodies,[19] and intergovernmental agencies such as the WHO.[20] The experiences of intersex people also testify to the complexity of sex and gender; female, male, and other gender identities are experienced across the many divergences of sexual difference.[21] The social sciences have a branch devoted to gender studies. Other sciences, such as psychology, sociology, sexology, and neuroscience, are interested in the subject. The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct, and gender studies particularly does, while research in the natural sciences investigates whether biological differences in females and males influence the development of gender in humans; both inform the debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity and gendered behavior. Biopsychosocial approaches to gender include biological, psychological, and social/cultural aspects.[22][23] Etymology and usage Derivation The modern English word gender comes from the Middle English gender, gendre, a loanword from Anglo-Norman and Middle French gendre. This, in turn, came from Latin genus. Both words mean \"kind\", \"type\", or \"sort\". They derive ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *ǵénh₁- \u0027to beget\u0027,[24] which is also the source of kin, kind, king, and many other English words, with cognates widely attested in many Indo-European languages.[25] It appears in Modern French in the word genre (type, kind, also genre sexuel) and is related to the Greek root gen- (to produce), appearing in gene, genesis, and oxygen. The Oxford Etymological Dictionary of the English Language of 1882 defined gender as kind, breed, sex, derived from the Latin ablative case of genus, like genere natus, which refers to birth.[26] The first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of gender as \"kind\" had already become obsolete. History of the concept The concept of gender, in the modern social science sense, is a recent invention in human history.[27] The ancient world had no basis of understanding gender as it has been understood in the humanities and social sciences for the past few decades.[27] The term gender had been associated with grammar for most of history and only started to move towards it being a malleable cultural construct in the 1950s and 1960s.[28] Before the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role developed, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories.[7][1] For example, in a bibliography of 12,000 references on marriage and family from 1900 to 1964, the term gender does not even emerge once.[7] Analysis of more than 30 million academic article titles from 1945 to 2001 showed that the uses of the term \"gender\", were much rarer than uses of \"sex\", was often used as a grammatical category early in this period. By the end of this period, uses of \"gender\" outnumbered uses of \"sex\" in the social sciences, arts, and humanities.[1] It was in the 1970s that feminist scholars adopted the term ",

Depiction of the Rebecca Riots, Illustrated London News 1855 The Rebecca Riots (Welsh: Terfysgoedd Beca) took place between 1839 and 1843 in West and Mid Wales.[1] They were a series of protests undertaken by local farmers and agricultural workers in response to levels of taxation. The rioters, often men dressed as women, took their actions against toll-gates, as they were tangible representations of taxes and tolls. The rioters went by the name of Merched Beca which translates directly from Welsh as \u0027Rebecca\u0027s Daughters\u0027. The riots ceased prior to 1844 due to several factors, including increased troop levels, a desire by the protestors to avoid violence, and the appearance of criminal groups using the guise of the biblical character Rebecca for their own purposes.[2] In 1844 an act of Parliament to consolidate and amend the laws relating to turnpike trusts in Wales was passed. History [edit] Events leading to the riots [edit] In the late 1830s and early 1840s, the agricultural communities of west Wales were in dire poverty.[3] In 1837 and 1838 the whole country suffered from poor harvests, worse in the south west, where atrocious seasons of rain forced farmers to buy corn at famine prices to feed themselves, their animals and their families, which further eroded what little capital they had.[3] Grain harvests collapsed, but the price of butter between 1837 and 1841, and sheep between 1839 and 1841, was relatively high, and even the low cattle prices of 1839 recovered by 1841.[3] But by 1842 a general fall in prices occurred throughout the agricultural markets that continued into 1843.[3] Cattle prices slumped sharply in 1842, and the blame was placed on the government, and in particular Robert Peel\u0027s tariff measures which eased importation of foreign cattle and meat.[3] In 1842, the harvest was one of the most successful in years, and that, combined with the contraction in demand from the Glamorgan ironworks, led to a slump in corn prices.[3] The farmers\u0027 economic position had therefore shifted from that of dire grain harvests with life supported by sheep and butter sales, to one where the price of their corn, when the weather was favourable, was very low. The diminution of the Glamorgan ironworks, coupled with the new tariff, also had an adverse effect on the prices of butter, cheese, pigs, horses, sheep and lean cattle, impacting harshly on the Welsh pastoral farmer.[3] The farmers were faced with a drastic reduction in their income, but had no financial relief in similar reductions in their outgoings, mainly rents, tithes, county rates, poor rates and the turnpike tolls.[4] Farm rents were mainly static, but the tithes, tolls and poor rates increased. Seeing themselves as victims of \u0027tyranny and oppression\u0027,[4] the farmers and their workers took the law into their own hands to rid themselves of these taxes. The first institutions to be attacked were the hated toll-gates.[4] In the early 19th century many toll-gates on the roads in Wales were operated by trusts which were supposed to maintain and improve the roads, funding this from tolls. However, many trusts charged high tolls but spent the money on other things. Even where this was not done, the toll-gate laws imposed an additional financial burden on poor farming communities. The \u0027oppression\u0027, felt by the farmers, began in the late 1830s, when a group of toll-renters bought the right to collect tolls in the region\u0027s trusts (a common practice for turnpike trusts), who then tried to aggressively tried to recoup their investment.[4] This group was led by Thomas Bullin, who was hated by those who paid his tolls.[5] The main reason for his dislike was the exacting method of the toll collection and the big toll increases of side-bars. The side-bars were simple toll-gates, away from the main trunk roads, placed strategically on by-roads to catch any traffic that had tried to bypass the main toll booths via side lanes.[4] These side-bars dramatically increased the cost of farmers\u0027 carting lime to their fields to fertilize or to reduce acidity in the soil. It was said[who?] that it cost ten times as much as the lime itself to cart it from Cardiff docks to a farm in the hills. Rebecca [edit] Cartoon published in Punch in 1843 The first appearance of Rebecca or Beca, as the members called themselves, occurred in 1839. Although this precedes the economic events of 1842, the early appearances of Rebecca were sporadic isolated outbursts, with the true body of rioting not beginning until the winter of 1842.[3] Although these early \u0027uprisings\u0027 were few and uncommon, they were the first appearance of mobs dressed in the guise of Rebecca. These gangs became known as Merched Beca (Welsh for \"Rebecca\u0027s Daughters\") or merely the Rebeccas. The origin of their name is said to be a verse i",

Married couples were encouraged to be chaste.[14][15] In the first century, Marcion of Sinope held an antisexual and ascetic outlook.[16] The Skoptsys were a radical sect of the Russian Orthodox Church that practiced castration and amputation of sexual organs. The Skoptsy believed that Christ had been castrated during his crucifixion, and it was this castration that brought about salvation.[17] Boston Corbett, who was involved in killing John Wilkes Booth, castrated himself after being mocked and tempted by prostitutes.[18] Ann Lee was the founder of the Shakers, a radical Protestant sect that opposed procreation and all sexual activity. The Shakers were more opposed to pregnancy than anything else.[19][better source needed] Father Divine, founder of the International Peace Mission Movement, advocated religious abstinence from sex and marriage and taught that sexual objectification is a root cause of undesirable social and political conditions.[20] James Baldwin in The Fire Next Time refers to the United States as an antisexual country dominated by a white culture that regards sensual or soulful behavior by Black Americans as suspect. This contributed to a crisis of Baldwin\u0027s Christian faith, showing that the world did not accept him, and that Christianity had not made white people accepting. Non-religious [edit] Philosopher Immanuel Kant viewed humans as being subject to the animalistic desires of self-preservation, species-preservation, and the preservation of enjoyment. He argued that humans have a duty to avoid actions that harm or degrade themselves, including suicide, sexual degradation, and drunkenness.[21]: 225  This led Kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it \"makes of the loved person an Object of appetite\",[22] rather than focusing on their inherent worth as rational beings, which violates Kant\u0027s second formulation of the categorical imperative, a philosophical concept he created to judge the morality of actions. He admitted sex only within marriage, which he regarded as \"a merely animal union\".[23] Feminist [edit] Various feminist views on sexuality have been described as anti-sex or sex-negative. In particular, second-wave and radical feminist viewpoints and thinkers have been subject to this, including from other feminists.[24][25][26] Prior to the second wave of feminism, which introduced such slogans as \"The personal is political\" in the 1960s, the subject of women\u0027s sexuality had rarely been addressed as a politicized subject, although the subjugation of women by aspects of male sexuality had been discussed.

Breeches, tight-fitting knee-length pants, were a standard male garment when these roles were introduced.[citation needed] The theatrical term travesti covers both this sort of cross-dressing and also male actors dressing as female characters. Both are part of the long history of cross-dressing in music and opera and later in film and television. In opera, a breeches role refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a mezzo-soprano or contralto.[1] The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in Fidelio or Gilda in Act III of Rigoletto) are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (The Marriage of Figaro), Octavian (Der Rosenkavalier), Hansel (Hansel und Gretel) and Orpheus (Orpheus and Euridice), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a castrato and later, in the revised French version, an haute-contre.[citation needed] Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., Peter Pan); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; Hamlet is not a breeches role, but Sarah Bernhardt once played Hamlet as a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as \"containing\" a breeches role, this does mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.[citation needed] History [edit] Dorothea Jordan as Hippolyta by John Hoppner, 1791 When the London theatres re-opened in the Stuart Restoration of 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the Shakespeare era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of Restoration comedy and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays. Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these cross-dressing roles subvert conventional gender roles by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration rakes, but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was \"little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object\". The epilogue to Thomas Southerne\u0027s Sir Anthony Love (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous \"breeches\" actress Susanna Mountfort (also known as Susanna Verbruggen): You\u0027ll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see, In a contented lazy waggery, The Female Mountford bare above the knee. Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelatio",

Femboy can be used as both a sexual and non-sexual term; it does not denote a specific sexual orientation or gender role. The term originated in the 1990s. It has since been popularised through internet forums and social media, starting on 4chan and expanding to other sites such as Reddit and TikTok, where hashtag trends such as \"#femboyfriday\" have received attention in the media. In gender studies, the term has also been used as an identifier for individuals on the transgender spectrum; in porn studies, the term has been seen as an identifier for a submissive role in intercourse and as exhibiting elements of sexual fantasy. Usage Etymology According to Dictionary.com, the term femboy originated at least in the 1990s. It is a compound noun from the words fem (an abbreviation of feminine and femme) and boy.[1][2] However, one early usage can be found in the 1981 release of the Abbreviations Dictionary by editor and photographer Ralph De Sola.[3] The variant femboi uses the LGBTQ term boi.[1] By 2000, the term boi[4] had come to denote \"a young, attractive gay man\". The term \"boi\" has also been used, independently of any meaning related to sexuality, as an alternate spelling for boy.[5] Definitions Collins English Dictionary defines femboy as \"a male whose appearance and behavioural traits are regarded as conventionally feminine\".[6] According to Dictionary.com, t",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sexual activity involving ejaculating on the face of another An illustration of a man ejaculating onto a woman\u0027s face A facial is a sexual activity in which a man ejaculates semen onto the face of one or more sexual partners.[1] A facial is a form of non-penetrative sex, though it is generally performed after some other means of sexual stimulation, such as vaginal sex, anal sex, oral sex, manual sex or masturbation. Facials are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene.[2] The performance of a facial is typically preceded by activities that result in the sexual arousal and stimulation of the ejaculating participant. After the prerequisite level of sexual stimulation has been achieved, and ejaculation becomes imminent, the male will position his penis in a way that allows the discharged semen to be deposited onto his partner\u0027s face. The volume of semen that is ejaculated depends on several factors, including the male\u0027s health, age, degree of sexual excitement, and the time since his last ejaculation.[3] Normal quantities of ejaculate range from 1.5 to 5.0 milliliters (1 teaspoon). Seconds after being deposited onto the face, the semen thickens, before liquefying 15–30 minutes later.[4] Cultural depictions Predating the modern age of pornography, facials were described in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing facials in his work The 120 Days of Sodom, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads \"… I show them my prick, then what do you suppose I do? I squirt the fuck in their face… That\u0027s my passion my child, I have no other… and you\u0027re about to behold it.\"[5] In mainstream pornography In the 1970s, the hardcore pornography genre introduced the stereotypical cumshot (also known as the money shot) scene as a central element (leitmotif) of the hardcore film, in which the male actor ejaculates in a way ensuring maximum visibility of the act itself.[6] These scenes may involve the female actor \"calling for\" the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body.[7] Now facial cumshots are regularly portrayed in pornographic films, videos, magazines and internet web sites.[2] In addition to mainstream pornography, the popularity of facials has led to creation of its own niche market,[8] like video series that specialize in showing the act. In 2010, psychologist Ana Bridges and colleagues conducted a content analysis of best-selling heterosexual pornographic videos showing that over 96% of all scenes concluded with a male performer ejaculating onto the body of his female partner.[9] The mouth was the most common area to be ejaculated upon. When all regions of the face are included, facial cum shots occur in approximately 62% of scenes where external ejaculation occurs.[10] In feminist pornography Further information: Feminist pornography § Facials When feminist pornography emerged in 1980s, pioneer Candida Royalle always excluded facial cum shots, and with few exceptions all other male external ejaculations, from her sex scenes.[11][12] Ms. Naughty\u0027s (since 2000)[13] and Petra Joy\u0027s work (since 2004) has followed the same principle.[14] In the early works of Tristan Taormino (starting in 1999), facials were also deliberately excluded, but after her thinking about feminist porn gradually changed, she sometimes included such acts in her later productions.[15] Erika Lust has occasionally featured facials ever since her 2004 debut The Good Girl.[16] Health risks Pain in the eye Getting semen in the eye can cause intense pain, sting and burn, because the semen contains components which irritate the ocular tissue. The reaction can be tearing, sensitivity to light, redness and blurry vision. The eye can be rinsed with clean water, the tears also help to flush out the semen, after which the discomfort will subside.[17] Transmission of disease Eye infected with chlamydial conjunctivitis. Any sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs).[18] Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed,[19][20] but not on the ocular tissue (Conjunctiva). However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as \"other potentially infectious material\" or OPIM.[21] If the man has chlamydia in his semen, the receiving partner may contract chlamydial conjunctivitis.[22] The risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner during the facial sexual act are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner there is almost no risk of contracting an STI. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher.[23] Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (i.e., eyes, lips, mouth), ther",

These communities generally celebrate pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality.[not verified in body] LGBTQ activists and sociologists see LGBTQ community-building as a counterweight to heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, sexualism, and conformist pressures that exist in the larger society. The term pride or sometimes gay pride expresses the LGBTQ community\u0027s identity and collective strength; pride parades provide both a prime example of the use and a demonstration of the general meaning of the term.[not verified in body] The LGBTQ community is diverse in political affiliation. Not all LGBTQ people consider themselves part of the LGBTQ community. Groups that may be considered part of the LGBTQ community include gay villages, LGBTQ rights organizations, LGBTQ employee groups at companies, LGBTQ student groups in schools and universities, and LGBTQ-affirming religious groups. LGBTQ communities may organize themselves into, or support, movements for civil rights promoting LGBTQ rights in various places around the world. At the same time, high-profile celebriti",

It is a recommended course of treatment for individuals experiencing gender dysphoria,[1][2] providing improved mental health outcomes in the majority of people.[3][4][5][6] A social transition may include coming out as transgender,[a] using a new name and pronouns, and changing one\u0027s public gender expression.[7] This is usually the first step in a gender transition. People socially transition at almost any age,[8][9] as a social transition does not involve medical procedures. It can, however, be a prerequisite to accessing transgender healthcare in many places.[10][11] In transgender youth, puberty blockers are sometimes offered at the onset of puberty to allow the exploration of their gender identity without the distress[12][13] of irreversible pubertal changes. Upon reaching the age of consent, they become eligible to pursue a medical transition if it is still desired. A medical transition may include hormone replacement therapy (HRT), transgender voice therapy, and gender affirming surgeries. The ability to start a medical transition is typically offered after a diagnosis of gender dysphoria,[14] a form of medicalization. In recent years, there has been a push for an informed consent model of transgender healthcare which allows adults to access HRT without a formal diagnosis.[15] Transitioning is a process that can take anywhere from several months to several years.

The Italian language is a language with a large set of inflammatory terms and phrases, almost all of which originate from the several dialects and languages of Italy, such as the Tuscan dialect, which had a very strong influence in modern standard Italian, and is widely known to be based on the Florentine language.[1] Several of these words have cognates in other Romance languages, such as Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, and French. Profanities differ from region to region, but a number of them are diffused enough to be more closely associated to the Italian language, and are featured in all the more popular Italian dictionaries. List of profanities in the Italian language [edit] Frocio, a translation of faggot accidenti [attʃiˈdɛnti]: (lit. \u0027accidents\u0027) used in the same context as the English \"damn\", either as an exclamation when something goes wrong or to wish harm (such as accidents) on someone (e.g. \"accidenti a te\", which can be translated as \"damn you\").[2] arrapare: sexually arouse someone.[3] arrapato: sexually aroused[4] arrapante: something or someone that arouses sexually, sexy[5] arrapamento or arrapatura: sexual arousal[6] baldracca (pl. baldracche) [balˈdrakka]: whore.[7] bastardo (pl. bastardi): bastard. bazzotto/barzotto: (referring to the penis) partially erect.[8] bocchino (pl. bocchini) [bokˈkiːno]: blowjob.[9] cagare (cacare is usually more common in Southern Italy. See Regional varieties of the Italian language): to shit, to defecate. It is used idiomatically to mean \"to give a fuck\" or, typically, \"not to give a fuck\" (with the verb in a negative form) about someone: \"A scuola nessuno mi caga\" (\"At school, nobody gives a fuck about me\"). Cognate with Spanish and Portuguese cagar, ultimately from Latin cacare. cagata/cacata: Bullshit, crap. Vai a cagare/cacare: fuck you, fuck off. cappella: the glans of the penis.[10] scappellare: to lower the foreskin to uncover the glans.[11] cazzo (pl. cazzi) [ˈkattso]: (lit. \u0027dick\u0027 or \u0027cock\u0027 or \u0027prick\u0027) used in numerous expressions to convey a variety of emotions such as anger, frustration, or surprise in a way similar to how ‘fuck’ is used in English. cazzo: fuck/shit/hell. che cazzo: what the hell/fuck. e che cazzo/ecche cazzo: for fuck’s sake!, oh come on!, seriously?!? che cazzo fai?: what the hell/fuck are you doing? cazzata: bullshit. cazzo in culo: cock up your ass. testa di cazzo: dick-head. incazzarsi: to get pissed off. incazzato: pissed off; incazzato nero: really pissed off. incazzatura: rage, anger.[12] incazzoso: someone who gets angry easily.[13] cazzeggiare: to fuck around.[14] cazzeggio: the act of fucking around.[15] cazzone (lit. \u0027big dick\u0027): stupid and foolish person.[16] cazzuto: very smart and tough person, badass.[17] scazzare: this word has many meanings: to annoy, bore, irritate someone, to fight with someone, to make somebody angry, to talk bullshit and to make mistakes.[18] scazzato: bored or angry person.[19] scazzo: difficult situation, boredom or fight, quarrel.[20] coglione (pl. coglioni) [koʎˈʎoːne]: a vulgar version of testicle; when referring to a person, it usually means idiot, berk, twit, fool.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Gay slang term for men who cruise for sex Troll and trolling are slang terms used almost exclusively among gay men to characterize gay, bisexual and questioning or bi-curious men who cruise or \"wander about looking\"[1] for sex or potential sex partners or experiences \"in a notably wanton manner and with lessened standards of what one will accept in a partner.\"[2] The term can be used positively or negatively depending on the speaker, usage and intent and can describe the person or the activity. Although often referring to \"an unattractive older gay man\"[3] and although troll as a slur \"is primarily a visual, not a behavioral\" judgment,[4] the phrases can be used for anyone who is trolling, regardless of the putative troll\u0027s age or perceived attractiveness. Pejorative use [edit] As a verb, \"to troll\" is not necessarily pejorative, with \"trolling for sex\" merely a synonym of cruising. The same is not true of \"troll\" as a noun describing a person, usually an elderly or unattractive gay male (a \"troll\") aggressively seeking younger partners (\"twinks\" or \"chickens\"). This usage carries all of the negative connotations associated with \"dirty old man\" outside the gay community; editorialists in the gay press also occasionally cite this usage as evidence that a gay community which values youth and physical attraction is marginalising its elderly.[5][6] Origin and historical usage [edit] A troll is a fearsome member of a race of creatures from Norse mythology that have achieved international recognition and become stock characters in popular culture. Troll as gay slang is amongst the lexicon of the cant Polari used in the gay subculture in Britain which has become more mainstream with transcontinental travel and online communication. There is still debate about how Polari originated but its origins can be traced back to at least the 19th century. The term troll may have become equated with cruising because a troll is a \"creature of Scandinavian folklore depicted as a devilish imp who lives in dark places and \u0027patrols\u0027 in an endless search.\"[2] \"The word trolla in Swedish means ‘to charm or bewitch’.\"[7] The linguist Paul Baker says, \"As a Polari word, troll can mean ‘to walk effeminately’, or ‘to walk, seeking sex’.\"[7] Trolling can be used almost interchangeably with cruising.[8] The word \"troll\" has remained unfamiliar even to many gay men in Britain, who have never heard, used, or needed to use the term. Regular customers in the same gay bar might have different takes on the usage – one simply referring to cruising, another referring to a negative version of a troll as a someone who \"will have your skin crawling in seconds with his lascivious looks and raunchy repartee,\"[9] another meaning older gays who prefer to troll for younger men.[10][11] Variations on troll exist. Paul Baker asserts that trolley-dolly may be \"derived perhaps from a combination of lalies and troll. A trolley-dolly (contemporary gay slang) is a gay flight attendant\".[12] \"Trolling\" is also a term used for generations among fishermen in boats, to describe the way they let a line with a hook and bait on the \"fishing line\" follow along behind the boat moving slowly, hoping that this slow baiting of the fish will result in a catch. In Gay sub-cultural slang usage would often be coded to seem as though the speaker was talking about \"fishing behavior\u0027\" but the \"gay slang\" usage decodes the message to mean \"cruising for sex\" and luring the potential contacts [catch]. The homosexual \"cruising\" could be called \"trolling\" to mean moving along slowly and letting potential contacts [\"catches\"] have opportunity to \"take the bait\" i.e. connect for sex. It does also carry the implicit meaning of being a behavior done by older less desirable men seeking sex in public places, but younger people may use the term either to describe serious sexual hunting, or to make light of it, and by using the term \"trolling\" to put a humorous light on what is considered to be a somewhat socially questionable behavior. [13] Etiquette [edit] Depending on the culture the men are in, the setting, time of day (or evening), how comfortable they are about their sexuality and their intentions will all affect the trolling experience. Some men are still coming out or even a virgin to same-sex experiences; some societies punish gays with prison, public humiliation and even death. So having the appearance of just walking through the area or using a restroom comes in handy until those there for sexual fulfillment can let their guard down as it becomes obvious everyone is there with like-minded goals. For regular areas or “troll haunts” that are frequented by a recurring group of trolls there is a general rule that \"as in most gay male settings, the young, the muscular, and the unfamiliar are more sought.\"[14] A troll\u0027s intention will also influence actions and outcomes ranging from casual sex in a more private area to exhibitionism l",

They planned to hold power until a new election was held. This ended a pseudo-democracy under the quasi-civilian government. The coup provoked a nationwide protest also demanding for a modern state which values the information technology knowledge of Generation Z, sees them as active social agents, with new revolutionary ideas, and fosters greater freedom of thought. Traditional groups as well as human rights defenders contested gender norms and stereotypes. In this study of the 2021 revolution, numerous changes in gender attitudes are documented. These include attitudes regarding cultural taboos about women\u0027s bodies; dominant masculine ideas about marginalized gender groups; and finally, women\u0027s political participation. Many urban youth protesters have been fighting against misogynist ideas and actively acknowledge women\u0027s roles in the political and social movements. Yet, in the power struggle between oppressors and oppressed, human dignity and moral principles have been caught in a bind, as women from both groups have been strategically targeted for personal attacks. Although this trend was not as apparent in previous anti-coup protests, this article argues that, despite some flaws, the revolution could be a driving force in changing gender perceptions in general. As such, this study observes how the 2021 revolution both deconstructed and reinforced traditional gender stereotypes and beliefs. With the aim of examining the driving forces and drawbacks of gender attitudes changes, this [End Page 29] investigation attempts to understand the gender equality movements, arising with the coup in 2021 and their impact on the landscape of women\u0027s participation in politics. Keywords Myanmar, women, gender, protest, revolutionary ideas, Generation Z Introduction In Myanmar, women have long fought for social justice and gender equality. These fights include those of the early nationalist movements that sought independence from colonialism and progressing to a massive social revolution in 2021. Attitudes toward Myanmar women as the guardians of the nation’s pride and culture have been fostered in tandem with the emergence of nationalism (Latt 2019:14). For example, nationalist movements during the democratization process (2010–2020) mobilized Burmese Buddhist ideologies to impose the inter-faith marriage law (Walton 2015:11). However, the anti-coup protest in the spring of 2021 stimulated gender activists to strive to demolish those very social taboos which had been strengthened by those conservative religious, nationalist discourses. They also sought to reconcile with different ethnic groups; through the protests, trans-ethnic solidarity has been built (Prasse-Freeman and Sebro 2021). In sum, the movement sought to overcome racism as well as sexism. During the military-dominated pseudo-democracy (2010–2021), Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) had space, time, and resources to build stronger networks through community and social mobilization (Lanjouw, Phuah, and Phan 2016:17–19). These networks enabled the breadth of the protests to be wider and stronger. The courage, leadership skill, and technical competence of Generation Z has been acknowledged (Kapi 2021); the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) of the working [End Page 30] class has been powerful (Myanmar Now 2021); and patriarchal values of the society have been challenged (Du 2021). In addition, activism for gender equality has grown during the anti-coup demonstrations. These gender equality initiatives were also intertwined with ethnic solidarity, labor movements, and the ideas of Generation Z while fighting for social justice. In this regard, the anti-coup protests of 2021 have been seen to intersect with a social revolution: the protesters promoted gender equality concepts and deconstructed traditional deep-rooted gender stereotypes related to religious and social norms. However, this study witnessed some shortcomings in this movement’s goals to change gender norms as it was impossible to eliminate all forms of negative gender stereotypes within a short period. This means that gender norms are likely to evolve in two directions in anti-coup movements. The first is",

Riesce infatti a caricarsi delle tracce, più o meno esplicite, del cambiamento intorno a noi, che costituisce la fibra primaria della lingua e della nostra comunicazione. Il futuro non è binario, è fluido Addentrarmi nel mondo della Generazione Z mi ha permesso di capire le nuove sfumature del cambiamento, soprattutto per quanto riguarda il concetto di genere. Un passaggio per me fondamentale, dopo il precedente articolo sul vocabolario dell’intimità, del corpo e del sesso, è affrontare l’immaginario della non-identificazione binaria dei generi, che caratterizza prepotentemente gli Z. Il cosiddetto concetto di fluidità (di genere), già in partenza, è difficile da definire, perché va contro la semantica stessa della parola. Prima di tutto, la parola fluido fa riferimento a un cambiamento che attraversa in modo trasversale il mondo Z, ovvero al labile confine che intercorre tra la comunicazione in rete (online) e la vita reale, materiale e analogica (offline), che il filosofo Luciano Floridi nel 2015 aveva definito con il neologismo onlife, un’esperienza di vita ibrida che scorre legata a dispositivi interattivi. Anche se, come ho sostenuto più volte in questa indagine, il digitale è uno dei fattori che ha permesso allo slang giovanile della Generazione Z di arricchirsi ed evolversi, la parola-chiave che ci lega al discorso di genere è confine. I termini fluido e confine infatti hanno uno stretto rapporto di corrispondenza. In senso generico, la fluidità ha la forma del passaggio, della capacità di scorrere da uno stato all’altro, nel linguaggio specifico della fisica e della chimica è l’opposto della viscosità. Anche se il suo movimento viene ricondotto all’instabilità e a una provvisoria mancanza di coesione, fu lo stesso Bauman nel saggio Amore liquido. Sulla fragilità dei legami affettivi (Laterza, 2018) ad affermare che «l’uomo deve essere fluido, flessibile, capace di adattarsi al contenitore sociale che di volta in volta assume forme diverse». Per i giovani Zedders, la parola fluido va ricondotta non solo, come sostiene Domitilla Pirro, direttrice creativa dell’Osservatorio sulla Gender Equality di Fronte del Borgo presso la Scuola Holden, alle «rivendicazioni libertarie assolutamente compatibili, per intensità, a quelle delle generazioni precedenti, rivendicazioni dopate però dalla tecnoliquidità», ma soprattutto a «una indiscussa fame di classificazione che ha poco a che vedere col Catch\u0027em all (per chi si ricorda i Pokémon, la traduzione è “prendili tutti!”) e tutto a che vedere con la ricerca identitaria». Gran parte degli adolescenti sta dunque sfidando il significato e i tradizionali vincoli di genere, ovvero le norme binarie e patriarcali della divisione sessuale e dell’identità in due categorie distinte: se «la generazione precedente ha avuto bisogno di creare categorie che hanno implicato delle aspettative sul proprio ruolo in società», mi spiega il team Loveducation di EDUXO, organizzazione no profit che svolge attività su tutto il territorio nazionale e ha grande seguito anche online, soprattutto sui social, «ad oggi, queste aspettative risultano cristallizzate in etichette. Non definirsi o utilizzare categorie dinamiche e modificabili permette di riconoscersi e quindi di esistere, senza necessariamente assumere un ruolo in società e senza rispondere ad alcuna aspettativa. Negli Z c’è una maggiore consapevolezza delle sfumature e delle variabili che riguardano l’identità di genere e l’orientamento sessuale, e questo li porta a riempire il vuoto nella narrazione linguistica e iconica, ereditata dalla generazione precedente e dalle strutture sociali che ci richiedono di definirci». Come aggiunge la sociolinguista Vera Gheno, negli ultimi anni c\u0027è stata un\u0027evoluzione del significato del termine fluido in rapporto all’identità di genere promossa dalla Generazione Z: «è come se si fosse passati dalla visione di questi aspetti della vita delle persone come un gradatum (o sei etero o omo, o sei cis, abbreviazione di cisgender, persona la cui identità di genere corrisponde al sesso assegnato alla nascita, o sei trans) a una visione come continuum (ci sono molte cose al di là di etero e omo e di cis e trans)». Gli Z per comunicare questa posizione usano infatti il termine genderfluid, spesso presente nella biografia di Instagram o come hashtag nei post: per Elia Bonci, classe \u002796, autore di Diphylleia. Solo l\u0027amore può distruggere l\u0027omofobia (Caravaggio Editore, 2019), «la parola genderfluid fa riferimento a quelle persone le quali percepiscono la loro identità di genere come fluida, la quale può variare nel tempo. Possono identificarsi come uomini, donne, entrambi o nessuno dei due. In genere preferiscono che vengano utilizzati nei loro confronti dei pronomi ne",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Social system in which males and heterosexuality are privileged In feminist theory, heteropatriarchy (etymologically from heterosexual and patriarchy) or cisheteropatriarchy, is a social construct where (primarily) cisgender (same gender as identified at birth) and heterosexual males have authority over other cisgender males, females, and people with other sexual orientations and gender identities. It is a term that emphasizes that discrimination against women and LGBT people is derived from the same sexist social principle.[1][2][3] The concept postulates that in heteropatriarchal societies, cisgender heterosexual men generally occupy the highest positions of power in society, causing women (including transgender women), non-binary people, transgender men, and other LGBT people to experience the bulk of social oppression in relation to gender and sexuality.[1] Theory [edit] The theory of the concept asserts that, as a social system, heteropatriarchy perceives heterosexuality and patriarchy as normal while other configurations are considered abnormal.[4] Normalization of heteropatriarchy is said to perpetuate an environment of oppression and inequality for racial and sexual minority groups.[5] Heteropatriarchy is a facet of popular feminist analysis used to explain modern hierarchical social structure, which is dependent upon, and includes, the perspective of gender roles, based on a system of interlocking forces of power and oppression. It is said to be commonly understood, in this context, that men typically occupy the highest positions of power and women experience the bulk of social oppression.[6] This system of socio-political dominance is said to be reinforced by gender norms, which ascribe traits of femininity and masculinity to people,[7] whereby cisgender heterosexual men are favored and are routinely remunerated for presenting masculine traits, and conversely, women and people who display traits deemed feminine receive less societal privilege. The concept implies that historically this has manifested in economic disadvantages such as unequal pay, or the inability for women to own land.[8] The practice of legal (and social) culture of relegating gender to the realm of \"women\u0027s issues\" and sexual orientation to the realm of \"sexual minorities\u0027 issues” is fundamental to this concept of a heteropatriarchal society.[9] It implies further, that not only are heterosexual men given primacy over other gender and sexual minorities, but they also are encouraged and rewarded by a heteropatriarchal society,[10] and that on the microscopic level, heteropatriarchy could be evident in consumption habits and relationships while on the macroscopic level, it is demonstrated by the glass ceiling, marriage, and the legal control over the bodies of women.[11] From a historical point of view, the term patriarchy refers to the father as the power holder inside family hierarchy, and thereby, women become subordinate to the power of men. Patriarchy is a social system in which men have predominant power and are dominant and have privilege in roles such as: political, economical, societal, and social roles. With the emergence of queer theory around the 1980s and the 1990s and the questioning of heteronormativity and gender binary in contemporary societies, this kind of domination was described not only in terms of gender (the predominance of men over woman, or the masculine over the feminine) or sex, but also in terms of sexuality (the heteronormativity, or heterosexuality above other sexual orientations and the cisgender over other identities).[1][12] The term heteropatriarchy is said to have evolved from what is described as the previous, less specific term \u0027patriarchy\u0027 in order to emphasize the formation of a male-dominated society based upon the cultural processes of sexism or heterosexism.[13] Background history [edit] The concept presumes that since ancient times, heteropatriarchy has shaped the way societies across the world have viewed masculinity and femininity and that this societal system has had negative effects on societies that remain apparent in modern days. Research by Evelyn Nakano Glenn postulates that Ancient China is an example that confirms this, being a society having male emperors with dominant power, in which women and people who showed feminine traits were objectified and oppressed. Exceptions to the premise not being addressed, women were seen as obedient housewives whose main purpose was to serve males.[14] The conclusion seems to be that due to this, the voices of women have been ignored and suppressed, leading to a system that grew into a society denying women rights and that they were dehumanized.[citation needed] Some contemporary research postulates that while there is no definitive origin for heteropatriarchy, various places and societies may have contributed significantly to its creation. The classical period of ancient Greek society is i",

It is more often considered to have multiple men and one woman, while a so-called \"reverse gang bang\" (one man and many women),[4] which can be seen in pornography. Female-on-female and male-on-male gang bangs also happen.[5] Gang bangs are not defined by the precise number of participants, but usually involve more than three people and may involve a dozen or more. When the gang bang is organized specifically to culminate with the (near) simultaneous or rapid serial ejaculations of all male participants on the central man or woman, then it may be referred to by the Japanese term bukkake.[1] Three people engaged in sex is normally referred to as a threesome, and four people are normally referred to as a foursome. Pornography [edit] See also: Candy Apples § World record gang bang Though there have been numerous gang bang pornographic films since the 1980s, they usually involved no more than half a dozen to a dozen men. However, starting with The World\u0027s Biggest Gangbang (1995) starring Annabel Chong with 251 partners, the pornographic industry began producing a series of films ostensibly setting gangbang records for most consecutive sex acts by one person in a short period.[6] These kinds of films were financially successful, winning AVN Awards for the best-selling pornographic films of their year; however, the events were effectively unofficiated and the record-breaking claims often misleading.[7] Jasmin St. Claire described her \"record\", purportedly set with 300 men in World\u0027s Biggest Gang Bang 2, as \"among the biggest cons ever pulled off in the porn business\", with merely about 30 men \"strategically placed and filmed,\" only ten of whom were actually able to perform sexually on camera.[8] See also [edit] Erotica and pornography portal Bukkake Group sex Orgy Swinging Gang rape References [edit] Look up gang bang in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

Femboy can be used as both a sexual and non-sexual term; it does not denote a specific sexual orientation or gender role. The term originated in the 1990s. It has since been popularised through internet forums and social media, starting on 4chan and expanding to other sites such as Reddit and TikTok, where hashtag trends such as \"#femboyfriday\" have received attention in the media. In gender studies, the term has also been used as an identifier for individuals on the transgender spectrum; in porn studies, the term has been seen as an identifier for a submissive role in intercourse and as exhibiting elements of sexual fantasy.

Someone assigned female at birth with a male gender identity is called a trans man. The opposite of transgender is cisgender. Trans women may have any sexual and romantic orientation, including being straight (attracted to men), lesbian (attracted to women), or bisexual. As part of social transition, trans women adopt a more feminine gender expression with the goal of being perceived as female, for example taking on a new name, hairstyle, clothing style, and voice which affirm one\u0027s identity. Trans women generally use she/her pronouns. Trans women also transition medically through gender-affirming medical treatment, in order to develop female sexual characteristics. A major component of this is feminizing hormone therapy, which causes the development of breasts. Some also undergo feminizing surgeries, including breast augmentation, facial feminization, vocal feminization, and vaginoplasty. Relatively few transgender people are able to access surgery, due to legal and financial obstacles.[5] Trans women face significant discrimination (called transmisogyny) in many areas of life—including employment and housing. In the United States, discrimination is particularly severe against non-white trans women, who exper",

The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with Western culture and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this article, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new article, as appropriate. (September 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Phyllis and Aristotle, a fictional tale written in the 13th century, as depicted by artist Giovanni Buonconsiglio in the early 1500s A dominatrix (/ˌdɒmɪˈneɪtrɪks/ ⓘ DOM-in-AY-triks; pl. dominatrixes or dominatrices /ˌdɒmɪˈneɪtrɪsiːz, ˌdɒmɪnəˈtraɪsiːz/ DOM-in-AY-triss-eez, DOM-in-ə-TRY-seez), or domme, is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities. The BDSM practice is called female dominance, or femdom. A dominatrix can be of any sexual orientation, but this does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. Dominatrices are popularly known for inflicting physical pain on their submissive subjects, but this is not done in every case. In some instances erotic humiliation is used, such as verbal humiliation or the assignment of humiliating tasks. Dominatrices also make use of other forms of servitude. Practices of domination common to many BDSM and other various sexual relationships are also prevalent. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (pro-domme) as the term dominatrix is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. Terminology and etymology [edit] Dominatrix is the feminine form of the Latin dominator, a ruler or lord, and was originally used in a non-sexual sense. Its use in English dates back to at least 1561. Its earliest recorded use in the prevalent modern sense, as a female dominant in sadomasochism, dates to 1961.[1] It was initially coined to describe a woman who provides punishment-for-pay as one of the case studies within Bruce Roger\u0027s pulp paperback The Bizarre Lovemakers.[2] The term was taken up shortly after by the Myron Kosloff title Dominatrix (with art by Eric Stanton) in 1968, and entered more popular mainstream knowledge following the 1976 film Dominatrix Without Mercy.[3] Femdom flag in the Leather subculture The term domme is likely a coined pseudo-French feminine inflection of the slang dom (short for dominant). The use of domme, dominatrix, dom, or dominant by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene.[4] The term mistress or dominant mistress is sometimes also used. Female dominance (also known as female domination or femdom) is a BDSM activity in which the dominant partner is female. However, while the term mistress is often used in the media and by paid professional dominatrices and their submissives, members of the BDSM community often avoid it. This is because it can be confused with mistress in the sense of a woman who has an illicit relationship with a married man, a term which has the negative implication of cheating on a partner. Since there is a large overlap between the BDSM and polyamory communities, where ethical conduct is a prime concern, any such relationship is a source of disapproval. Although the term dominatrix was not used, the classic example in literature of the female dominant-male submissive relationship is portrayed in the 1870 novella Venus in Furs by Austrian writer Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The term masochism was later derived from the author\u0027s name by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in the latter\u0027s 1886 forensic study Psychopathia Sexualis. History [edit] Erotic photograph, c. 1930s, showing a dominant female music teacher caning the buttocks of a submissive female student with a violin bow The history of the dominatrix is argued to date back to rituals of the goddess Inanna (or Ishtar as she was known in Akkadian), in ancient Mesopotamia. Ancient cuneiform texts consisting of \"Hymns to Inanna\" have been cited as examples of the archetype of the powerful, sexual female displaying dominating behaviors and forcing gods and men into submission to her.[5] The pseudonymous archaeologist and BDSM historian Anne O. Nomis notes that Inanna\u0027s rituals included cross-dressing of cult personnel, and rituals \"imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initiation and journeys of altered consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves with weeping and grief.\"[6] The fictional tale of Phyllis and Aristotle, which became popular and gained numerous versions from the 12th century onwards, tells the story of a dominant woman who seduced and dominated the male intellect of the greatest philosopher. In the story, Phyllis forces Aristotle to kneel on the ground so that she rides on his back while whipping and verbally humiliating him.[7][8] The profession appears to have originated as a specialization within brothels, before becoming its own ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Traditional role in British pantomime Dan Leno as Widow Twankey in Aladdin at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane - Alfred Ellis (1896) A pantomime dame is a traditional role in British pantomime. It is part of the theatrical tradition of travesti portrayal of female characters by male actors in drag. Dame characters are often played either in an extremely camp style, or else by men acting butch in women\u0027s clothing. They usually wear heavy make up and big hair, have exaggerated physical features, and perform in an over-the-top style. Dame characters [edit] Modern pantomime dames Characters who are played as pantomime dames are often, though not exclusively, older, matronly women. They may be the protagonist\u0027s mother, as in Jack and the Beanstalk and Robinson Crusoe, or a nursemaid to the protagonist, as in Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Although often warm and sympathetic characters, dames may also be employed as comic antagonists, such as with the Ugly Sisters, wicked stepmother or the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella.[1] Although some pantomimes traditionally do not contain standard dame roles, certain productions of those stories add a dame character, for example, in many versions of Peter Pan.[2] Pantomime dames often have numerous costume changes in a performance, each costume change being more extravagant than the last. Other examples of dame characters include: Widow Twankey, Aladdin\u0027s mother in the pantomime versions of the story Mother Goose The nanny or nurse in Babes in the Woods The cook in Dick Whittington The queen in Puss in Boots Goldilocks\u0027 mother in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, who runs a circus in many versions of the pantomime.[3] Notable pantomime dames [edit] Peter Alexander – (born 1952), notable dame in pantomimes in Yorkshire Trevor Bannister – (1934–2011), British actor Stanley Baxter – (born 1926), award winning Scottish actor and impressionist, famous for his lavish productions, notably at The King\u0027s Theatre, Glasgow Christopher Biggins – (born 1948), TV personality, actor Steven Blakeley – (born 1982), has appeared in numerous pantomimes at the Theatre Royal, Windsor Douglas Byng – (1893–1987), a legendary dame who appeared in over 50 pantomimes, Byng was also a noted cabaret and revue artiste.

Scarica Parlare della fluidità di genere Dentro la Generazione Z di Beatrice Cristalli 9 minuti 07 gennaio 2021 Il linguaggio trattiene in sé molto di più di quello che possiamo immaginare. Riesce infatti a caricarsi delle tracce, più o meno esplicite, del cambiamento intorno a noi, che costituisce la fibra primaria della lingua e della nostra comunicazione. Il futuro non è binario, è fluido Addentrarmi nel mondo della Generazione Z mi ha permesso di capire le nuove sfumature del cambiamento, soprattutto per quanto riguarda il concetto di genere. Un passaggio per me fondamentale, dopo il precedente articolo sul vocabolario dell’intimità, del corpo e del sesso, è affrontare l’immaginario della non-identificazione binaria dei generi, che caratterizza prepotentemente gli Z. Il cosiddetto concetto di fluidità (di genere), già in partenza, è difficile da definire, perché va contro la semantica stessa della parola. Prima di tutto, la parola fluido fa riferimento a un cambiamento che attraversa in modo trasversale il mondo Z, ovvero al labile confine che intercorre tra la comunicazione in rete (online) e la vita reale, materiale e analogica (offline), che il filosofo Luciano Floridi nel 2015 aveva definito con il neologismo onlife, un’esperienza di vita ibrida che scorre legata a dispositivi interattivi. Anche se, come ho sostenuto più volte in questa indagine, il digitale è uno dei fattori che ha permesso allo slang giovanile della Generazione Z di arricchirsi ed evolversi, la parola-chiave che ci lega al discorso di genere è confine. I termini fluido e confine infatti hanno uno stretto rapporto di corrispondenza. In senso generico, la fluidità ha la forma del passaggio, della capacità di scorrere da uno stato all’altro, nel linguaggio specifico della fisica e della chimica è l’opposto della viscosità. Anche se il suo movimento viene ricondotto all’instabilità e a una provvisoria mancanza di coesione, fu lo stesso Bauman nel saggio Amore liquido. Sulla fragilità dei legami affettivi (Laterza, 2018) ad affermare che «l’uomo deve essere fluido, flessibile, capace di adattarsi al contenitore sociale che di volta in volta assume forme diverse». Per i giovani Zedders, la parola fluido va ricondotta non solo, come sostiene Domitilla Pirro, direttrice creativa dell’Osservatorio sulla Gender Equality di Fronte del Borgo presso la Scuola Holden, alle «rivendicazioni libertarie assolutamente compatibili, per intensità, a quelle delle generazioni precedenti, rivendicazioni dopate però dalla tecnoliquidità», ma soprattutto a «una indiscussa fame di classificazione che ha poco a che vedere col Catch\u0027em all (per chi si ricorda i Pokémon, la traduzione è “prendili tutti!”) e tutto a che vedere con la ricerca identitaria». Gran parte degli adolescenti sta dunque sfidando il significato e i tradizionali vincoli di genere, ovvero le norme binarie e patriarcali della divisione sessuale e dell’identità in due categorie distinte: se «la generazione precedente ha avuto bisogno di creare categorie che hanno implicato delle aspettative sul proprio ruolo in società», mi spiega il team Loveducation di EDUXO, organizzazione no profit che svolge attività su tutto il territorio nazionale e ha grande seguito anche online, soprattutto sui social, «ad oggi, queste aspettative risultano cristallizzate in etichette. Non definirsi o utilizzare categorie dinamiche e modificabili permette di riconoscersi e quindi di esistere, senza necessariamente assumere un ruolo in società e senza rispondere ad alcuna aspettativa. Negli Z c’è una maggiore consapevolezza delle sfumature e delle variabili che riguardano l’identità di genere e l’orientamento sessuale, e questo li porta a riempire il vuoto nella narrazione linguistica e iconica, ereditata dalla generazione precedente e dalle strutture sociali che ci richiedono di definirci». Come aggiunge la sociolinguista Vera Gheno, negli ultimi anni c\u0027è stata un\u0027evoluzione del significato del termine fluido in rapporto all’identità di genere promossa dalla Generazione Z: «è come se si fosse passati dalla visione di questi aspetti della vita delle persone come un gradatum (o sei etero o omo, o sei cis, abbreviazione di cisgender, persona la cui identità di genere corrisponde al sesso assegnato alla nascita, o sei trans) a una visione come continuum (ci sono molte cose al di là di etero e omo e di cis e trans)». Gli Z per comunicare questa posizione usano infatti il termine genderfluid, spesso presente nella biografia di Instagram o come hashtag nei post: per Elia Bonci, classe \u002796, autore di Diphylleia. Solo l\u0027amore può distruggere l\u0027omofobia (Caravaggio Editore, 2019), «la parola genderfluid fa riferimento a quelle persone le quali percepiscono la loro identità di genere come fluida, la quale può variare nel tempo. Possono identificarsi come uomini, donne, entrambi o n",

    "content": "There’s a common misconception that pride flags only represent an individual’s sexual preferences. However, anyone who doesn’t fall into the “traditional” definitions of femininity or masculinity can find a pride flag that represents them perfectly. A great example is the femboy flag. But what is a femboy? And what does their flag symbolize, precisely? Keep reading to find out the answers to these common questions about femboys. RELATED: What Does The Word “Queer” Mean To You? The Internet Sounds Off… What’s A Femboy? Before we go into the nitty-gritty details about the femboy flag, it’s vital to lay down the basics, like what a femboy is. How about we take this to the next level? Our newsletter is like a refreshing cocktail (or mocktail) of LGBTQ+ entertainment and pop culture, served up with a side of eye-candy. Daily * Weekly * Promotions and Partner Emails * The term “femboy” is defined (by Tumblr and other community-based websites) as “a boy with feminine physical characteristics.” More established sources like the Collins Dictionary include only adolescent males under this definition, while others assert that a femboy can be anyone under 30. Age aside, most people seem to agree that the chief characteristics of a femboy are femininity and perceived youth. However, this loose definition can be confusing – for example, some mistakenly believe that femboys (a term exclusively used by and for men) are the same as crossdressers or drag queens (who can identify with any gender). Are Femboys Gay? While some femboys may certainly be gay, this doesn’t apply to everyone. After all, being a femboy has nothing to do with one’s sexual preferences or gender. Instead, it is simply a label for men (cis or trans) who take on traditionally feminine characteristics. Is “Femboy” A Slur? Femboy is usually a harmless self-identifier, although it can become a slur when used in specific contexts generally involving a level of willful ignorance. So, when does femboy become a slur? One example is when a person uses the term to describe a transgender woman. By calling a trans woman a “femboy”, you’d be invalidating their gender identity and affixing ideas of masculinity upon them, despite them being women. That said, femboy, when used in the proper context, is not a slur. The Femboy Pride Flag So, now that you understand what a femboy is, let’s take a look at their pride flag. As with many other burgeoning queer communities, there have been many iterations of the femboy flag, with some being more inclusive than others. Here are the two most popular types of femboy flags currently used online and during Pride. Seven Stripes Flag The seven stripes banner is the most recognizable femboy flag to date, although many people may initially confuse it with the transgender pride flag. This pink, blue, and white banner shares many traits with other flags that represent the concepts of femininity and masculinity, but the color order is what sets it apart. The outer pink stripes represent femininity, similar to the lesbian flag. These flank the other colored bands because “femininity” is the first thing people see when meeting a femboy. Before going inward to the blue masculine center, the flag has a stark white stripe representing passing and non-binary people. Combining all the colors in this specific way encapsulates that experience of being a femboy. Look at the beautiful Femboy flag *^* pic.twitter.com/IPwmQBbzH6 — Alocq ???? (@Alocq5) June 6, 2022 Mars Symbol Flag A less popular variation of the femboy flag prominently features a mars symbol on top of a pink and white background. This serves the same purpose as the more recognizable striped flag but swaps out the blue center for the mars symbol, which is traditionally used to represent masculinity. That said, there is some controversy over this specific flag. Some trans individuals have started using this flag to represent their identity, creating confusion around its use. As a result, this flag isn’t often used within the trans and femboy communities. Final Thoughts On The Femboy Pride Flag While the femboy community doesn’t have an “official” flag representing their identity, they do have a few options when choosing which banner to hang up in their homes or post on social media profiles. But no matter which you choose, what’s important is being able to live your truth with pride.

In 2017, the name was formally changed to OCLC, Inc.[4] OCLC and thousands of its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog in the world.[5] OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries pay (around $217.8 million annually in total as of 2021[update]) for the many different services it offers.[2] OCLC also maintains the Dewey Decimal Classification system. History [edit] OCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for libraries in the state of Ohio. The group first met on July 5, 1967, on the campus of Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization[6] and hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, as first executive director.[7][8] Kilgour and Ralph H. Parker, who was the head of libraries at the University of Missouri, had proposed the shared cataloging system in a 1965 report as consultants to the Committee of Librarians of the Ohio College Association.[8] Kilgour and Parker wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library.[8] They were inspired in part by the earlier Columbia–Harvard–Yale Medical Libraries Computerization Project, an attempt at shared automated printing of catalog cards.[8] The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management, bringing libraries together cooperatively to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide.[6] Between 1967 and 1977, OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio, but in 1978, a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join. With this expansion, the name changed to the Online Computer Library Center in 1977.[9] In 2002, the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States.[10] As OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio, it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with \"networks\", organizations that provided training, support and marketing services. By 2008, there were 15 independent United States regional service providers. OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance, with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council. During 2008, OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels; at the same time, the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance. In early 2009, OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center.[11] In July 2010, the company was sued by SkyRiver, a rival startup, in an antitrust suit.[12] Library automation company Innovative Interfaces joined SkyRiver in the suit.[13] The suit was dropped in March 2013, however, following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces.[14] Innovative Interfaces was bought by ExLibris in 2020, therefore passing OCLC as the dominant supplier of ILS services in the U.S. (over 70% market share for academic libraries and over 50% for public libraries for ExLibris, versus OCLC\u0027s 10% market share of both types of libraries in 2019).[15] In 2022, membership and governance expanded to include any institution with a subscription to one",

    "title": "Handle System - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Hdl (identifier)) Specification for persistent identifiers of Internet resources The Handle System is a proprietary registry assigning persistent identifiers, or handles, to information resources, and for resolving \"those handles into the information necessary to locate, access, and otherwise make use of the resources\".[1] As with handles used elsewhere in computing, Handle System handles are opaque, and encode no information about the underlying resource, being bound only to metadata regarding the resource. Consequently, the handles are not rendered invalid by changes to the metadata. The system was developed by Bob Kahn at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) as a part of the Digital Object Architecture (DOA). The original work was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) between 1992 and 1996, as part of a wider framework for distributed digital object services,[2] and was thus contemporaneous with the early deployment of the World Wide Web, with similar goals. The Handle System was first implemented in autumn 1994, and was administered and operated by CNRI until December 2015, when a new \"multi-primary administrator\" (MPA) mode of operation was introduced. The DONA Foundation[3] now administers the system\u0027s Global Handle Registry and accredits MPAs, including CNRI and the International DOI Foundation.[4] The system currently provides the underlying infrastructure for such handle-based systems as Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and DSpace, which are mainly used to provide access to scholarly, professional and government documents and other information resources. CNRI provides specifications and the source code for reference implementations for the servers and protocols used in the system under a royalty-free \"Public License\", similar to an open source license.[5] Thousands of handle services are currently running. Over 1000 of these are at universities and libraries, but they are also in operation at national laboratories, research groups, government agencies, and commercial enterprises, receiving over 200 million resolution requests per month.[citation needed] Specifications [edit] The Handle System is defined in informational RFCs 3650,[1] 3651[6] and 3652[7] of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); it includes an open set of protocols, a namespace, and a reference implementation of the protocols. Documentation, software, and related information is provided by CNRI on a dedicated website[8] Handles consist of a prefix which identifies a \"naming authority\" and a suffix which gives the \"local name\" of a resource. Similar to domain names, prefixes are issued to naming authorities by one of the \"multi-primary administrators\" of the system upon payment of a fee, which must be renewed annually. A naming authority may create any number of handles, with unique \"local names\", within their assigned prefixes. Two example of handles are: 20.1000/100 2381/12345 In the first example, which is the handle for the HANDLE.NET software license, 20.1000 is the prefix assigned to the naming authority (in this case, Handle.net itself) and 100 is the local name within that namespace. The local name may consist of any characters from the Unicode UCS-2 character set. The prefix also consists of any UCS-2 characters, other than \"/\". The prefixes consist of one or more naming authority segments, separated by periods, representing a hierarchy of naming authorities. Thus, in the example 20 is the naming authority prefix for CNRI, while 1000 designates a subordinate naming authority within the 20 prefix. Other examples of top-level prefixes for the federated naming authorities of the DONA Foundation are 10 for DOI handles; 11 for handles assigned by the ITU; 21 for handles issued by the German Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG), the scientific computing center of the University of Göttingen; and 86 for the Coalition of Handle Services – China. Older \"legacy\" prefixes issued by CNRI before the \"multi-primary administrator\" (MPA) structure was instituted are typically four of five digits, as in the second example above, a handle administered by the University of Leicester. All prefixes must be registered in the Global Handle Registry through an DONA Foundation approved registrar, normally for a fee. As with other uses of handles in computing, the handle is opaque; that is, it encodes no information about the underlying resource and provides only the means to retrieve metadata about the resource. This may be contrasted with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which may encode within the identifier such attributes of the resource as the protocol to be used to access the server holding the resource, the server host name and port number, and perhaps even location specifics such as the name of a file in the server file system containing the resource. In the Handle System, these speci",

(November 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Contrary to their physical positions, for the \"top, bottom, and versatile\" sexual position, the man lying on his back is said to be in the \"top position\" and the other man is said to be in the \"bottom position\" In human sexuality: top, bottom, and versatile are roles during sexual activity, especially between two (or more) males. A top is usually a person who penetrates, a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and someone who is versatile engages in either or both roles. These terms may be elements of self-identity that indicate an individual\u0027s usual preference and habits, but might also describe broader sexual identities and social roles.[1] The terms top and bottom do not refer to the literal physical position during sex. For men who have sex with men and do not engage in anal sex, the term \"side\" has been proposed and has seen commercial use. Side men do not engage in anal sex but rather enjoy non-penetrative sex. Top [edit] A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for men who have sex with men (MSM), this often involves penetration using the penis during anal and oral sex.[1] Top is also used as a verb meaning \"to penetrate another.\" Top may also describe a broader personal identity involving the display of dominance and authority in a romantic or sexual relationship; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top. Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a total top or pure top is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex.[2] A power top is one noted for their great skills or aggressiveness in penetrating their bottoms. Increasingly the term rough top is used on apps such as Grindr to describe a dominant top who penetrates with particular aggression often as a show of masculinity and power, and to let the submissive bottom know they are being sodomized hard as a way to psychologically humiliate them. A service top is \"one who tops under the direction of an eager bottom,\" or is submissive while being the one who penetrates.[3] A versatile top is one who prefers to top but who bottoms occasionally, colloquially, a soft top.[4] The terms penetrative partner[5] or giver are synonyms of top, created to describe the act of penetrating without implying non-egalitarian relations among participants.[citation needed] Bottom [edit] A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSM who are penetrated via the anus during anal sex.[1] Bottom is also used as a verb meaning \"to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally.\" Bottom may also describe a wider social context of submission within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom. For example, a power bottom may refer to someone who takes a more dominant role while being the receptive partner.[6] In gay male sexuality, a total bottom is someone who assumes an exclusively receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A versatile bottom is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.[7] The terms receiver or receptive partner may be preferred by some. An oral bottom is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or oral top, with unreciprocated fellatio or irrumatio. Versatile [edit] Group sex where all men but the first and the last are versatile Versatile, or vers, refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.[1][8][9] Flip-flop or flip fuck commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men.[10] Each participant penetrates the other and is penetrated in his turn. Versatility is a concept of lifestyle.[11] Versatility, though, is not limited to the simple acts of anal, oral, or vaginal penetration, but also includes the splitting of duties and responsibilities in the relationship.[12] The reciprocal scenario, where both men take turns fucking each other, is oft",

Calabar adornments Bird Feather stalks An adornment is generally an accessory or ornament worn to enhance the beauty or status of the wearer. They are often worn to embellish, enhance, or distinguish the wearer, and to define cultural, social, or religious status within a specific community. When worn to show economic status, the items are often either rare or prohibitively expensive to others. Adornments are usually colourful, and worn to attract attention. They have a long history, around the world, from feathers or bone, to modern accessories, such as jewellery.[1] Items of adornment are also used by warriors, and by other members of the military to show rank or achievement.[2] Items of adornment [edit] These include cosmetics, jewellery, clothing accessories, facial hair, fingernail modification, piercing, lip plates, tattooing, braiding, and headgear. Cultures, subcultures, and institutions [edit] Groups who practice adornment include the yakuza, military, religious institutions, tribal groups, and the punk culture.[3] Items of adornment can provide information about a person\u0027s rank, social status, gender role, area of origin, etc. An example would be the beaded jewelry worn by the Maasai tribe, which is very specific to them and some related tribes. In Islamic culture, adornments have included caps such as the kufi and taqiyah for men,[4][5][6] and the hijab for women.[7] Images [edit] A heavily adorned general A Shona witch doctor wearing skins and beads Pope Benedict XVI Punk adornment A modern example of adornment: Bling-bling Maasai beaded jewelry Examples of social attire, a form of adornment, from the European Renaissance through the 19th Century See also [edit] Fashion accessory Permanent jewellery Body modification Native American jewelry References [edit] ^ \"Types and Forms of Ancient Jewelry from Central Asia - Neva - Transoxiana 10\".

Femboy can be used as both a sexual and non-sexual term; it does not denote a specific sexual orientation or gender role. The term originated in the 1990s. It has since been popularised through internet forums and social media, starting on 4chan and expanding to other sites such as Reddit and TikTok, where hashtag trends such as \"#femboyfriday\" have received attention in the media.

Created in October 2004, the board has influenced internet culture through a series of Internet memes, the most notable of which being the controversial NPC Wojak in 2016. It also has attracted much criticism for the user base involvement in the GamerGate controversy between 2014–15. Background [edit] 4chan was launched on 1 October 2003 by Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from New York City using the online handle \"moot\".[2] At its founding, the site only hosted one board: /b/ (Anime/Random).[3] It was advertised as an English-language counterpart to Futaba Channel and a place for Western fans to discuss anime and manga.[4][5] In June 2004, 4chan experienced six weeks of downtime due to PayPal suspending 4chan\u0027s donations service after receiving complaints about the site\u0027s content.[6] Following 4chan\u0027s return, several non-anime related boards were introduced, including /k/ (Weapons), /o/ (Auto), and /sm/ (Shota/Male).[7] On 9 October 2004, the addition of several boards were announced; /ib/ (Oekaki Random, now defunct), /ip/ (Oekaki Pro, now defunct), /tech/ (Technology, now called /g/) and /v/ (Video Games)[8] Since its introduction, /v/ has grown to become one of the most viewed and used boards on the website.[9] Multiple other boards were eventually spawned from /v/, forming their own section of the website; /vg/ (Video Game Generals, dedicated to game franchises), /vm/ (Video Games/Multiplayer, for multiplayer video games), /vmg/ (Video Games/Mobile, for mobile video games), /vp/ (Pokémon), /vr/ (Retro Games), /vrpg/ (Video Games/RPG, for Role-playing video games) and /vst/ (Video Games/Strategy, for strategy video games).[10] Culture and Influence [edit] A graph of the userbase of the /v/ board between January and June 2012. Green represents anonymous users, blue those who post with a tripcode, and red those who do under an alias In the early years of the board, \"is this Battletoads?\" was a common response to any video game screenshot shared in the site, this later spread to /b/ and starting in 2007, trolls began calling GameStop stores asking for pre-order copies of a sequel that at the time didn\u0027t exist, as a new game wouldn\u0027t appear until Battletoads (2020). These calls, frequently vulgar in tone, continued into 2010 to the frustration of local employees, some of whom would become enraged at the mention of the game.[11] Beginning in early 2011, 4chan users organized a mass prank calling to the Gold and Silver pawn shop, home to the popular television show Pawn Stars. The callers would repeatedly ask the employees if they sold Battletoads. This call led Rick Harrison, star of Pawn Stars and owner of the store, to repeatedly swear and yell at the callers, who recorded this and uploaded it to YouTube. This originated a series of many other similar videos of pranksters dialling random establishments and asking about Battletoads.[12][13] Battletoads developer Rare has acknowledged the prank via an achievement named \"Do You Have Battletoads?\" in their 2015 game compilation Rare Replay.[14] While the video game Minecraft was in its early stage of development, its creator Markus \"Notch\" Persson promoted the game in 4chan, among other places. The video game was subject of discussion in the /v/ board and this contributed to its spread and popularity. As an acknowledgement of the board, \"Notch\" added the phrase \"Woo, /v/!\" to one of the title screen\u0027s rotating splash messages in a 2010 Java build of the game. Similar references to other websites like Facepunch, Something Awful and TIGSource were also done. This reference never appeared outside the Java version of the game, and was present for over a decade. Only on Java Edition 1.17, launched on 27 May 2021, was the splash message quietly removed with no mention in the patch notes. According to Kotaku contributor Ian Walker, this was done by Microsoft (owner of Minecraft since 2014) in order to distance the company from the legacy of the game\u0027s creator.[15][16] Since 2011, /v/ has been represented in an online event known as the 4chan Cup: a series of online football matches between different teams that represent each board with their own culture and memes. Using heavily modded versions of different Pro Evolution Soccer video games, the matches are automated (computer-vs-computer) but each team is managed by a human player. The first edition(in which /v/ was already present) took place on August 2011 and is st",

    "title": "Gold star (LGBTQ slang) - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Gold star (slang)) Slang for a type of lesbian or gay man In LGBTQ slang, a \"gold star lesbian\" is a lesbian who has never had sex with a man, and a \"gold star gay\" is a gay man who has never had sex with a woman. The terms can be used jokingly, be sincerely held identities, or be stereotypes within the LGBTQ community. When used sincerely, the terms have been criticised as exclusionary towards bisexuality and other experiences of gender and sexuality, and as stigmatising survivors of sexual violence. The related term \"gold star asexual\" refers not to past sexual experience, but to an asexual person whose asexuality cannot be attributed to trauma, disability or other external factors. History [edit] The earliest known written documentation of the term comes from the 1995 book Revolutionary Laughter: A World of Women Comics, which quotes a stand-up act by lesbian comedian Carol Steinel, who said, “I’m not, in fact, a gold star lesbian — that’s a lesbian who’s never slept with a man. No, I know it’s shocking, but it’s true — I did, once, accidentally sleep with a man. For a year.”[1] The term was later used by Howard Stern to describe Melissa Etheridge on The Howard Stern Show in 1998, and on The L Word in 2006.[2] Gold star gay and lesbian [edit] The term gold star lesbian can position women who have never had sex with men as \"more authentic\", as they are not \"contaminated\" by men, according to Lucy Jones in Dyke/Girl (2012).[3] It can be used as a humorous rejection of heterosexuality.[4] In Cosmopolitan, Marianne Eloise wrote that the term can be a source of pride or comfort to some lesbians, including those with traumatic experiences of masculinity, but that it has cissexist implications.[5] It can also be derogatory towards bisexual women.[3] Shelby and Dolan, in Lesbian Women and Sexual Health (2014), reported that gold star lesbian can be used by lesbians to stigmatise other women who have past or present sexual relationships with men.[6] The social psychologist Petra Boynton, in an opinion column for The Daily Telegraph, said it is a \"toxic label\" that excludes bisexual women, diversity within sexuality and gender, victims of sexual violence and other life experiences. Boynton said it can also be used as \"a slur against lesbians\".[7] Elizabeth Pearce, in her PhD thesis documented people identifying as femme lesbians who were met dismissively by other lesbians, whether through lack of a \"gold star\" or disbelief that they were a \"gold star lesbian\".[8] John Paul Brammer, in his memoir ¡Hola Papi! How to Come Out in a Walmart Parking Lot and Other Life Lessons (2021), described gold star gay as a \"prolific\" phrase in gay circles, and associated it with a \"performative disgust\" for women\u0027s genitalia or bodies that can \"reduce women\". Brammer rejected the term for treating a part of his past—his high school relationship with a girlfriend—as \"disposable\".[9] In Feminist Studies, Nan Alamilla Boyd analysed lesbian history as \"the history of an idea rather than a group of people\", and considered the concept \"gold star lesbian\" (or \"lifelong lesbian\") to hold \"a lot of ideological weight\". Boyd commented that the homophile movement predates the identity \"lesbian\", but that the idea of a lifelong lesbian later became useful to particular communities.[10] In a PhD thesis, Caroline Lippy said that \"gold star lesbian\" is a \"community stereotype\" reflective of communication or empathy barriers between some lesbians: a \"gold star lesbian\" may be unable to provide empathy or advice to a lesbian with wider sexual experiences.[11] Gold star asexual [edit] The term gold star asexual, coined in 2010 by a blogger, refers to an asexual person who is able-bodied, sociable and in all other ways considered \"normal\". It is a hypothetical ideal of a person whose asexuality will not be dismissed, as it could not be attributed to trauma or other factors. The term is a response to prejudice that being sexual is better than being asexual. Unlike other gold star terms, it does not indicate anything about past sexual activity.[12][13][14] Silver star gay and lesbian [edit] The term silver star lesbian refers to a lesbian who has had sex with one man in the past, and then no more.[3][15] Example usages [edit] Andy Cohen has identified with the term gold star gay; in his memoir Superficial (2016), he recounts a story about his attitude towards a threesome with a heterosexual couple in light of his pride for being a \"gold star gay\".[16] In an article by the BBC, the BBC described the lesbian pornographic actor Lily Cade as a \"gold star lesbian\", in connection with her refusal to have sex with transgender women.[17] In \"Emergency Contact\" (2017), a season 9 Will \u0026 Grace episode, the term platinum star gay is jokingly used by a character to indicate that he is not only a \"gold star gay\", but was born via Caesarean section.[18] The term has, nonetheless, become controve",

Such aromantics may adopt labels for more specific identities on the aromantic spectrum, such as \"grayromantic\" (romantic attraction rarely experienced or only weakly experienced) or \"demiromantic\" (only experiencing romantic attraction after a strong emotional bond has been formed with the target).[8][12] As the experience of romantic attraction is subjective, some aromantic ",

Throughout history, the role of trousers is a constant change for women. The first appearance of trousers in recorded history is among nomadic steppe-people in Western Europe. Steppe people were a group of nomads of various different ethnic groups that lived in the Eurasian grasslands. Archaeological evidence suggests that men and women alike wore trousers in that cultural context.[1] However, for much of modern history, the use of trousers has been restricted to men. This norm was enforced in many regions due to social customs and laws. There are, however, many historical cases of women wearing trousers in defiance of these norms such as the 1850s women rights movement, comfort, freedom of movement, fashion, disguise (notably for runaway slaves),[2] attempts to evade the gender pay gap, and attempts to establish an empowered public identity for women.[3] Especially in the 20th and 21st centuries, the customs and laws restricting this manner of dress have relaxed dramatically, reflecting a growing acceptance and normalisation of the practice.[4] The teaching of Orthodox Jews and some Christian denominations, such as Conservative Anabaptists and the Methodists of the conservative holiness movement, continue to enjoin women to wear full-length dresses, rather than trousers in order to maintain what they see as a distinction in the sexes.[5][6][7] Amazon wearing trousers and carrying a shield with an attached patterned cloth and a quiver. Ancient Greek Attic white-ground alabastron, ca. 470 BCE, British Museum, London. Antiquity [edit] Further information: Trousers § Antiquity Although some images from Mycenaean Greece (c. 1750 – c. 1050 BCE) suggest both women and men wore primitive trousers, in classical ancient Greece and ancient Rome, trousers were rarely worn in general.[8] Instead, both wore a tunic as undergarment, with Roman women wearing a stola and men a toga as upper garment.[8] Amongst the Germanic peoples, men generally wore long trousers, and women sometimes as well.[8] It seems that ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians wore no trousers but a vast array of aprons, robes, cloaks, and knee skirts.[8] On the other hand, all Persians wore tight trousers, regardless of sex; at a later stage, they adopted some cloaks from the Assyrians.[8] Other ancient Iranian peoples such as Scythians, Sarmatians, Sogdians and Bactrians among others, along with Armenians and Eastern and Central Asian peoples such as the Xiongnu/Hunnu, are known to have worn trousers.[9][10] Trousers are believed to have been worn by both sexes among these early users.[11] Western dress reform and laws in the 19th century [edit] France in the 19th century [edit] Journal Amusant, number 737, 12 February 1870 From 1800 until 2013, women in Paris, France were technically forbidden from wearing trousers without permission from police, with only a few exceptions. Enforcement of this largely stopped only during World War I and after.[12][13] In the 1850s, painter Rosa Bonheur had to ask permission from the police to wear trousers, as this was her preferred attire to go to the sheep and cattle markets to study the animals she painted.[14] Laws against cross-dressing and vagrancy in the United States [edit] Various U.S. cities, in the 19th and 20th centuries, passed legislation barring women from wearing trousers. Among these U.S. cities include a 1863 law passed by San Francisco\u0027s Board of Supervisors criminalising appearing in public in \"a dress not belonging to his or her sex\", although similar laws existed in Columbus, Ohio (passed 1848); Chicago, Illinois (passed 1851); Houston, Texas (passed 1864); Orlando, Florida (passed 1907), and approximately two dozen other US cities.[15] Anti-cross-dressing laws continued to pass well into the 20th century, with Detroit, Michigan, and Miami, Florida, passing laws into the late 1950s.[15] Additionally, existing laws such as anti-vagrancy statutes were pressed into service to ensure that women would dress in accord with the gender norms of the time. One such instance would be New York\u0027s anti-vagrancy statute of 1845, which stated that \"Every person who, having his face painted, discoloured, covered or concealed, or being otherwise disguised, in a manner calculated to prevent him from being identified, shall appear in any road or public highway, or in any field, lot, wood or inclosure, may be pursued and arrested\".[16] This law was used to prosecute women for cross-dressing, on the grounds that their dressing outside of gender norms constituted a \"disguise\".[2] Boston used similar anti-vagrancy laws to arrest Emma Snodgrass and her friend Harriet French in 1852. (Snodgrass would be arrested again in Cleveland in 1853, and French would be arrested again in New York in 1856.) French reportedly broke with convention in",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Cross dressing ball) Cross-dressing and homosexuality events Gay balls, cross-dressing balls, pansy balls, or drag balls were (depending on the place, time, and type) public or private balls that were celebrated mainly in the first third of the 20th century, where cross-dressing and ballroom dancing with same-sex partners was allowed. By the 1900s, the balls had become important cultural events for gays and lesbians, even attracting tourists. Their Golden Age was during the interwar period, mainly in Berlin and Paris, even though they could be found in many big cities in Europe and the Americas, such as Mexico City and New York City. Precedents [edit] \"Molly\" or \"macaroni\" from the 18th century By the end of the 17th century, a gay subculture is documented in Europe, with cruising areas, bars, parties and balls, cross-dressers, and slang. Scholars like Randolph Trumbach consider it as the moment when gay subculture appeared in Europe. On the contrary, historian Rictor Norton considers unlikely that such a subculture would appear fully formed, and thinks that it was actually the increase in surveillance and police procedures that brought to the surface an underground culture that had not been visible up to that moment.[1] The archives of the Portuguese Inquisition in Lisbon preserve information of the so-called \"danças dos fanchonos\" from the beginning of the 17 century.[2] About 1620, the \"fachonos\", the baroque equivalent of modern drag queens, organized big parties in the Gaia Lisboa, the gay Lisbon. These itinerant celebrations, called \"escarramão\", or \"esparramão\", used to include pantomimes with racy scenes, where some of the participants were dressed as women, and other as men.[3] His Majesty\u0027s High Court in Mexico City discovered in 1656 a similar case, when Juan Correa, an old man, over 70 years old, confessed that he had been committing the unspeakable vice since his childhood. Correa\u0027s house, in the outskirts of the city, had been used as a meeting point to celebrate balls, where many men dressed as women.[4] Several studies have not found similar phenomena in the judicial cases in Aragon,[5] Catalonia,[6] the Basque Country[7] or Valencia,[8] even though in the Valencian case there are evidences of a subculture and a possible gay ghetto. In Spain, cross-dressing was socially only allowed for carnival, when even those closest to the king could dress as women.[9] On the other hand, in France, during Louis XIV\u0027s reign, no ball was complete without cross-dressers.[9] By the end of the 17th century, there was a completely developed gay subculture in London, with the molly houses used as clubs, where gays met regularly to drink, dance and have fun. These taverns are well known thanks to the Mother Clap\u0027s molly house scandal from 1726, when a police raid discovered that her molly house was a gay brothel.[1] Cross-dressing balls [edit] Hermann von Teschenberg (1866–1911) dressed as woman. Teschenberg, a cross-dresser, was one of the founders of the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. Germany [edit] The Empire [edit] Berlin\u0027s clandestine gay underground can be followed up to the 18th century, in spite of the persecution gays were suffering. In Prussia, Paragraph 143 of the penal code, and later the introduction of Paragraph 175 in the German penal code, with other laws for public scandal, and child protection, made the life of gays extremely difficult. In fact, the activities of Magnus Hirschfeld or the first homosexual movement could not avoid the regular police raids and closing of premises in the 1900s. And not just the premises were being watched by the police, in 1883, the moral police had 4799 \"transvestite\" and transgender woman under vigilance, even though \"permits\" could be handed out to cross-dressers in cases considered \"medical\".[10] It is thus surprising that, beginning mid 19th century, the Urningsball or Tuntenball came to be, balls of uranians, or queens, tolerated, but watched by the police. By the 1900s, these balls had achieved such a fame in Germany, that people from all around the country, and even foreign tourists, would travel to Berlin to participate.[10] These balls were celebrated in large ballrooms, as the Deutscher Kaiser, in the Lothringer Straße, or the Filarmonía, in the Bernburgstraße, the Dresdner Kasino, in the Dresdner Straße, or the Orpheum, in the Alter Jakobstraße 32.[11] For example, the Berliner Morgenpost described extensively on October 17, 1899, a gay ball that had taken place in the hotel König von Portugal, where balls were still being celebrated in 1918.[10] The ball season used to begin in October and go until Easter, with a frequency of several balls a week, sometimes two the same day.[11] Hirschfeld, in his book Berlins drittes Geschlecht (1904; \"Berlín\u0027s Third Sex\"), described the balls in following fashion: The innkeepers of uranian taverns, but certainly not just them, organize large u",

Moreover, the issue of domestic violence in same-sex relationships has not been studied as comprehensively as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.[2] However, there are legal changes being made to help victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships, as well as organizations that cater specifically to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships.[3][4][5] Prevalence [edit] General [edit] The Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention states, \"For several methodological reasons – nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others – it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Gay slang term for a gay man A \"friend of Dorothy\" (FOD) is a code word for a gay man, first used in LGBTQ slang.[1] Stating that, or asking if, someone is a friend of Dorothy is a furtive way of suggesting sexual orientation while avoiding hostility.[2] The term was likely based on the character Dorothy Gale of the Oz series of novels, which have been interpreted as including much queer subtext. Actress Judy Garland, who portrayed Dorothy in the 1939 Wizard of Oz film, is considered a gay icon. Writer and critic Dorothy Parker is thought to be another potential origin of the term. The \"friend of Dorothy\" code word was commonly used throughout the 20th century, but its use has declined in recent decades as LGBT acceptance has advanced. Dorothy from Oz and Judy Garland [edit] Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her \"queer friends\", based on whom the shibboleth may be coined. Dorothy from Oz [edit] The precise origin of the term is unknown. Some believe that it is derived from The Road to Oz (1909), a sequel to the first Oz novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). The book introduces readers to Polychrome, who, upon meeting Dorothy\u0027s travelling companions, exclaims, \"You have some queer friends, Dorothy.\" Dorothy replies, \"The queerness doesn\u0027t matter, so long as they\u0027re friends.\"[3] There are numerous references to LGBTQ characters and relationships,[4] including a possible innuendo about bisexuality – when Dorothy asks Scarecrow which way to go on the yellow brick road, he says, \"Of course some people go both ways\"[5] – although it is unknown whether these references were intentional.[6] For instance, in a case that may be seen as changing gender identity, or being transgender,[7] Ozma, the daughter of the former King Pastoria of Oz, was given as an infant to the witch Mombi of the North by the Wizard of Oz. Mombi transformed Ozma into a boy and called him \"Tip\" (short for Tippetarius) in order to prevent the rightful ruler of Oz from ascending to the throne.[8] Thus, Ozma spent her entire childhood with Mombi in the form of the boy Tip, and had no memory of ever having been a girl.[6] Later, Princess Ozma would be the ruler of the fictional land of Oz. Princess Ozma has been referred to as “one of the first transgender characters in literature.\"[9] This storyline was revived in the TV show Emerald City (2017).[8] The Wizard of Oz [edit] More commonly, it is stated that \"friend of Dorothy\" refers to the 1939 film adaptation The Wizard of Oz because Judy Garland, who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a gay icon.[10][11] The Wizard of Oz has a \"particular resonance in the culture of the queer community\".[12] The struggles faced by Dorothy, Toto, and friends, especially against the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys, can metaphorically mirror the difficulties of coming out.[12] How this group of outcasts works together likewise mirrors LGBTQ people who create new chosen families.[12] Researchers also note the film is absent of a heteronormative male–female romance, and Dorothy and her friends \"do not need to change themselves to become who they want to be\".[13] Many see Garland\u0027s portrayal as a \"queer journey, an escape from the puritanical, morally rigid, black-and-white small-town life to Technicolor city existence with fabulous friends\".[14][15] Additionally relevant is the classic song \"(Somewhere) Over the Rainbow\" that Dorothy (Judy Garland) sings, which was possibly \"the most memorable performance\" of Garland\u0027s career, and the song \"contributed to the evolution of the rainbow flag as a gay icon\".[16] The song \"act[ed] as a cultural catalyst, propelling the eventual embrace of the rainbow symbol by the world\u0027s LGBTQ communities\".[16] Time magazine, in its August 18, 1967, review of Garland\u0027s final engagement at New York\u0027s Palace Theatre, observed: \"A disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual. The boys in the tight trousers roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats, particularly when Judy sings [\u0027Over the Rainbow\u0027].\"[15][17] Judy Garland [edit] Main article: Judy Garland as a gay icon LGBTQ people could also empathize with Judy Garland\u0027s struggles in personal life.[18][19] Garland\u0027s problems — \"the drinking and divorcing, all the pills and all the men, all the poundage come and gone\" — were documented in the media.[19] She was among the first stars to have her \"dirty laundry\" aired publicly.[14] She was the \"archetype of the triumphant/tragic diva, paving the way for the stormy trajectories of superstars Elizabeth Taylor, Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, and Lindsay Lohan\".[14] Biographer Gerald Clarke thinks she was likely bipolar, \"explaining her many suicide attempts and use of alcohol and pills to self-medicate.\"[14] Her mental health problems were likely related to childhood trauma,[20][21] possibly untreated complex PTSD,[citation needed] a common shared experience with LGBT",

Both terms include derogatory terms for homosexuals (fag and fruit).[2][3] The term, which originated in the United States in the 1990s,[2][4] is the male equivalent of the more common slang term \"fag hag\",[5] a term which is part of hag-ism: the identification of a person with a group—usually united in terms of sexuality, gender identity, or shared sex—of which they are not a member.[6] The term can be used as a pejorative or as a term of endearment within LGBTQ communities.[7][8][9] Usage [edit] The colloquialism is used, albeit rarely, primarily within the LGBTQ communities.[10][11] Mainstream shows, such as Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Queer as Folk, Will \u0026 Grace and others, often explore the mainstreaming of friendships where differing sexualities play a complement rather than impediment to friendships and social situations.[5][12][13] In addition, homophobia has become less prevalent, and efforts to confront violence and hostility towards sexual and gender minorities, such as gay–straight alliance, has helped lift some of the stigma attached to having LGBTQ people as close friends.[5][12] A 2002 episode of the MTV series Undressed was titled \"Fag Stag\" and centered on a gay wedding.[14][15] When Radar magazine debuted, its founder and editor-in-chief, Maer Roshan, called competitor Details\u0027 editor-in-chief Dan Peres a \"professional fag stag\",[16] stating, \"Let\u0027s get one thing straight, Peres is not gay. But his magazine sure seems to be.\"[16] In regards to heterosexual males, the term fag stag is not to be confused with the term gay icon. The term gay icon is used for a celebrity (gay or straight) who is highly regarded by the gay community. While one can be both a fag stag and a gay icon concurrently, the terms are not synonymous.[5][13][17] See also [edit] LGBTQ portal Fag hag Straight ally Footnotes [edit] ^ Newall, Venetia (1986-01-31). \"Folklore and Male Homosexuality\".

It was founded in 1994 in Montreal as an alternative punk magazine,[2] and its founders later launched the youth media company Vice Media, which consists of divisions including the printed magazine as well as a website, broadcast news unit, a film production company, a record label, and a publishing imprint. As of February 2015, the magazine\u0027s editor-in-chief is Ellis Jones.[3][4] On 15 May 2023, Vice Media formally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as part of a possible sale to a consortium of lenders including Fortress Investment Group, which will, alongside Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital, invest $225 million as a credit bid for nearly all of its assets.[5] In February 2024, CEO Bruce Dixon announced additional layoffs and that the website Vice.com will no longer publish content.[6][7][8] The print magazine returned in September 2024.[9][10] History [edit] The precursor to Vice magazine was founded in October 1994 in Montreal under the name Voice (later Voice of Montreal), by Interimages Communications. It was a spin-off of the English-language portion of Images magazine, a multicultural publication founded in the early 1990s by Dominique Ollivier with Alix Laurent,[11] under the name Voice of Montreal.[12] Issue no. 1 lists Laurent and Ollivier as publishers, with Suroosh Y. Alvi as editor and Gavin McInnes as assistant editor, with Shane Smith joining the magazine\u0027s staff later.[13][14][15][16] The magazine was established under a job creation program of the Quebec government to allow social welfare recipients to gain work experience. It focused on Montreal\u0027s alternative cultural scene, including music, art, trends and drug culture, to compete with the already established Montreal Mirror. During the 1990s, Montreal\u0027s Plateau Mont-Royal/Mile-End neighbourhood was home to a burgeoning subculture with the advent of collectives such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Dummies Theatre, Bran Van 3000 and later Arcade Fire.[17][18] Alvi, McInnes and Smith bought out the publisher and changed the magazine\u0027s name to Vice in 1996.[19][20] Richard Szalwinski, a Canadian software millionaire, acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in 1999.[21] Following the relocation, the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and politically incorrect content. Under Szalwinski\u0027s ownership, a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine. However, due to the end of the dot-com bubble, the three founders eventually regained ownership of the Vice brand, followed by closure of the stores.[16] The British edition of Vice was launched in 2002 and Andy Capper was its first editor. Capper explained in an interview shortly after the UK debut that the publication\u0027s remit was to cover \"the things we\u0027re meant to be ashamed of\", and articles were published on topics such as bukkake and bodily functions.[22] By the end of 2007, 13 foreign editions of Vice magazine were published, the Vice independent record label was functional, and the online video channel VBS.com had 184,000 unique viewers from the U.S. during the month of August. The media company was still based in New York City, but the magazine began featuring articles on topics that were considered more serious, such as armed conflict in Iraq, than previous content. Alvi explained to The New York Times in November 2007: \"The world is much bigger than the Lower East Side and the East Village.\"[16] McInnes left the publication in 2008, citing \"creative differences\" as the primary issue. In an email communication dated 23 January, McInnes explained: \"I no longer have anything to do with Vice or VBS or DOs \u0026 DON\u0027Ts or any of that. It\u0027s a long story but we\u0027ve all agreed to leave it at \u0027creative differences,\u0027 so please don\u0027t ask me about it.\"[23] At the commencement of 2012, an article in Forbes magazine referred to the Vice company as \"Vice Media\", but the precise time when this title development occurred is not public knowledge.[24] Vice acquired the fashion magazine i-D in December 2012 and, by February 2013, Vice produced 24 global editions of the magazine, with a global circulation of 1,147,000 (100,000 in the UK). By this stage, Alex Miller had replaced Capper as the editor-in-chief of the UK edition. Furthermore, Vice consisted of 800 worldwide employees, including 100",

Mudoko dako also could be found among the Teso and the Karamojan people.[1] Recognition of the mudoko dako can be traced back prior to colonialism in Africa.[3] Mudoko dako was considered an \"alternative gender status\" and were able to marry men with no social sanctions.[1] The word, dako, in the Lango language means \"woman\".[4] In his work, The Lango: A Nilotic Tribe of Uganda (1923), anthropologist Jack Herbert Driberg describes the mudoko dako people among the Langi. Driberg describes how men, known as Jo Apele or Jo Aboich, go on to become mudoko dako, dressing in the manner of women and taking on women\u0027s traditional roles.[5] Driberg even observed mudoko dako simulating menstruation.[5] References [edit] ^ a b c Murray, Stephen O.; Roscoe, Will, eds.

The term cisgender was coined in 1994 as an antonym to transgender, and entered into dictionaries starting in 2015 as a result of changes in social discourse about gender.[4][5] Related concepts are cisnormativity (the presumption that cisgender identity is preferred or normal) and cissexism (bias or prejudice favoring cisgender people). Etymology The term cisgender has its origin in the Latin-derived prefix cis-, meaning \u0027on this side of\u0027, which is the opposite of trans-, meaning \u0027across from\u0027 or \u0027on the other side of\u0027. This usage can be seen in the cis–trans distinction in chemistry, the cis and trans sides of the Golgi apparatus in cellular biology, the ancient Roman term Cisalpine Gaul (i.e. \u0027Gaul on this side of the Alps\u0027), and Cisjordan (as distinguished from Transjordan). In cisgender, cis- describes the alignment of gender identity with assigned sex.[6][7] History and usage of the term Coinage German Marquis Bey states that \"proto-cisgender discourse\" arose in German in 1914, when Ernst Burchard introduced the cis/trans distinction to sexology by contrasting \"cisvestitismus, or a type of inclination to wear gender-conforming clothing, [...] with transvestitismus, or cross-dressing.\"[8][9] German sexologist Volkmar Sigusch used the term cissexual (zissexuell in German) in his two-part 1991 article \"Die Transsexuellen und unser nosomorpher Blick\" (\"Transsexuals and our nosomorphic view\"); in 1998, he said he had coined the term there.[10] English The term cisgender was coined in English in 1994 in a Usenet newsgroup about transgen",

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[34] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5,[35] capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing.[36] As of 2025[update], the Python Software Foundation supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, following the projects annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates. Python has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[37][38][39][40] It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.[41] Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.[42] History Main article: History of Python The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at PyCon US 2024 Python was conceived in the late 1980s[43] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde \u0026 Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.[44] It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[45] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Python implement",

Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military. Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs\u0027 influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \"man\u0027s best friend\". The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.

It is an obligate carnivore, requiring a predominantly meat-based diet. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting, and body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones. Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems. Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. The domestic cat is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat started in the Near East around 7500 BCE. Today, the domestic cat occurs across the globe and is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. It is commonly kept as a pet, working cat, and pedigreed cat shown at cat fancy events. Out of the estimated 600 million domestic cats worldwide, 400 million reside in Asia, including 58 million in China. The United States leads in cat ownership with 73.8 million cats, followed by the United Kingdom with approximately 10.9 million cats. It also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. Pet abandonment contributes to increasing of the global feral cat population, which has driven the decline of bird, mammal, and reptile species. Population control includes spaying and neutering. Etymology and naming The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska \u0027wildcat\u0027 and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[6] The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi \u0027female stoat\u0027, and Hungarian hölgy \u0027lady, female stoat\u0027; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä \u0027female (of a furred animal)\u0027.[8] The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology is unknown, but it may be an onomatopoeia from using a sound to attract a cat.[9][10] A male cat is called a tom, tommy or tomcat[11] (or a gib,[12] if neutered). A female is called a queen (or sometimes a molly,[13] if spayed).[14] Some sources write that queen refers solely to unspayed cats that are in an estrous cycle.[15] A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten (shortened to kitty in British English[16]), a term interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling in Early Modern English.[17] A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder, a glaring,[18] or a colony.[19] Taxonomy The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.[1][2] Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.[3] Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.[20][21] In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature conserved the name silvestris Erxleben 1777 for the wildcat, but did not suppress catus Linnaeus 1758.[22][23] In 2007, the modern domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus was sampled worldwide and considered to have probably descended from the African wildcat (F. lybica), following results of phylogenetic research.[24][25][a] In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce, following the",

PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.[13] It is supported on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses, data lakes,[14] or web services with many concurrent users. The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components. This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor. These include special-purpose database engine features, like those needed to support a geospatial[15] or temporal[16] database or features which emulate other database products.[17][18][19][20] Also available from third parties are a wide variety of user and machine interface features, such as graphical user interfaces[21][22][23] or load balancing and high availability toolsets.[24] The large third-party PostgreSQL support network of people, companies, products, and projects, even though not part of The PostgreSQL Development Group, are essential to the PostgreSQL database engine\u0027s adoption and use and make up the PostgreSQL ecosystem writ large.[25] PostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.[26][27] In 1996, the project was renamed PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.[28] History [edit] Ingres and University POSTGRES (1982–1994) [edit] PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, Michael Stonebraker, left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.[26] He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the Turing Award in 2014 for these and other projects,[29] and techniques pioneered in them. The new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types.[30] These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships – something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.[31] Starting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM SIGMOD Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers[32] and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2[33] on June 30, 1994 – primarily a cleanup – the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter, which could be interactively used with a console application named monitor. Postgres95 (1994–1996) [edit] In 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. The monitor console was also replaced by psql. Yu a",

It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.[19] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022[update] according to GitHub.[20] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[21] Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun\u0027s Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle, which bought Sun in 2010, offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM, which is open-source software used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. Java 25 is the version current as of September 2025[update]. Java 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25 are long-term support versions still under maintenance. History See also: Java (software platform) § History Duke, the Java mascot James Gosling, the creator of Java, in 2008 James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[22] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[23] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling\u0027s office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[24] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[25] Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[26] It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[27] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively. In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[28][29][30] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[31] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementatio",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Organized collection of data in computing This article is about the computing concept. For instances of the general concept, see Lists of databases. An SQL select statement and its result In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a database management system (DBMS), the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term \"database\" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. Before digital storage and retrieval of data have become widespread, index cards were used for data storage in a wide range of applications and environments: in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes in a card file. Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes until they were replaced by indexing software in the 1980s and 1990s. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance. Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages. Terminology and overview Formally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data accessed through the use of a \"database management system\" (DBMS), which is an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized. Because of the close relationship between them, the term \"database\" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it. Outside the world of professional information technology, the term database is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.[1] Existing DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups: Data definition – Creation, modification and removal of definitions that detail how the data is to be organized. Update – Insertion, modification, and deletion of the data itself.[2] Retrieval – Selecting data according to specified criteria (e.g., a query, a position in a hierarchy, or a position in relation to other data) and providing that data either directly to the user, or making it available for further processing by the database itself or by other applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a more or less direct form without modification, as it is stored in the database, or in a new form obtained by altering it or combining it with existing data from the database.[3] Administration – Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.[4] Both a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular database model.[5] \"Database system\" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.[6] Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable storage. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large-volume t",

Find sources: \"Web scraping\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (April 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.[1] Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis. Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping). As well as contact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup, and web data integration. Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include market research, price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data. Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server. There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing. History [edit] After the birth of the World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[2] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web. In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, Jump Station was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot. In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public.[3] Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.

(June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Femboy can be used as both a sexual and non-sexual term; it does not denote a specific sexual orientation or gender role. The term originated in the 1990s. It has since been popularised through internet forums and social media, starting on 4chan and expanding to other sites such as Reddit and TikTok, where hashtag trends such as \"#femboyfriday\" have received attention in the media. In gender studies, the term has also been used as an identifier for individuals on the transgender spectrum; in porn studies, the term has been seen as an identifier for a submissive role in intercourse and as exhibiting elements of sexual fantasy. Usage Etymology According to Dictionary.com, the term femboy originated at least in the 1990s. It is a compound noun from the words fem (an abbreviation of feminine and femme) and boy.[1][2] However, one early usage can be found in the 1981 release of the Abbreviations Dictionary by editor and photographer Ralph De Sola.[3] The variant femboi uses the LGBTQ term boi.[1] By 2000, the term boi[4] had come to denote \"a young, attractive gay man\". The term \"boi\" has also been used, independently of any meaning related to sexuality, as an alternate spelling for boy.[5] Definitions Collins English Dictionary defines femboy as \"a male whose appearance and behavioural traits are regarded as conventionally feminine\".[6] According to Dictionary.com, t",

The information need can be specified in the form of a search query. In the case of document retrieval, queries can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science[1] of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds. Cross-modal retrieval implies retrieval across modalities. Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload. An IR system is a software system that provides access to books, journals and other documents; it also stores and manages those documents. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications. Overview [edit] An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance. An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.[2] Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,[3] audio,[4] mind maps[5] or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata. Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.[6] History [edit] there is ... a machine called the Univac ... whereby letters and figures are coded as a pattern of magnetic spots on a long steel tape. By this means the text of a document, preceded by its subject code symbol, can be recorded ... the machine ... automatically selects and types out those references which have been coded in any desired way at a rate of 120 words a minute — J.

Holmstrom, 1948 The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article As We May Think by Vannevar Bush in 1945.[7] It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a \u0027statistical machine\u0027 – filed by Emanuel Goldberg in the 1920s and 1930s – that searched for documents stored on film.[8] The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948,[9] detailing an early mention of the Univac computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy Desk Set. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by Gerard Salton at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents).[7] Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s. In 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cosponsored the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very la",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Content provided by a website The home page of NASA from 2008 A web page (or webpage) is a Web document that is accessed in a web browser.[1] A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The term \"web page\" is therefore a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book. Navigation [edit] Main article: Web navigation Each article on the Wikipedia website is a distinct web page. The URL is visible in the browser\u0027s address bar at the top. Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their web browser, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then transforms it into an interactive visual representation on the user\u0027s screen.[2] If the user clicks or taps a link, the browser repeats this process to load the new URL, which could be part of the current website or a different one. The browser has features, such as the address bar, that indicate which page is displayed. Elements [edit] A web page is a structured document. The core element is a text file written in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This specifies the content of the page,[3] including images and video. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specify the presentation of the page.[3] CSS rules can be in separate text files or embedded within the HTML file. The vast majority[4] of pages have JavaScript programs, enabling a wide range of behavior.[3] The newer WebAssembly language can also be used as a supplement.[5] The most sophisticated web pages, known as web apps, combine these elements in a complex manner. Deployment [edit] From the perspective of server-side website deployment, there are two types of web pages: static and dynamic. Static pages are retrieved from the web server\u0027s file system without any modification,[6] while dynamic pages must be created by the server on the fly, typically reading from a database to fill out a template, before being sent to the user\u0027s browser.[7] An example of a dynamic page is a search engine results page. Security [edit] The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the way a web browser retrieves webpage content from a website. HTTP has two optional security features: encrypted mode (HTTPS) greatly reduces the possibility of eavesdropping by a third party,[8] while Content Security Policy protects against cross-site scripting attacks.[9] Both features are supported by mainstream web browsers, and many websites use them.

Spinning a lingering web in its wake were the robots, spiders, Worms(WWW), and Crawlers(Web)... Bringing order to the Chaos of the newly formed Galaxy were a bunch of Yahoos. The wisdom and greatness of the elder Yahoos has gone unquestioned and unchallenged for an eternity... the Seekers of Information could not obtain all of the great one\u0027s secrets, nor could the shockwaves from the great Excitement rattle the sacred altar of Yahoo!. But now, there is a new force in the universe... the Hotomi Bot(1) threatens to tear apart the very fabric of the web! Personal Sob Story Introduction My earliest encounter with the World Wide Web was during my freshman year at MIT. I was working late one night at the Media Lab, a lowly research assistant trying to learn the ropes of a technology that nobody outside of the lab, let alone myself, knew anything about. Suddenly an e-mail from one of the other late-night vigilantes (it was 4 A.M., but most of the workstations were occupied) came across the lab network. The message was about some new global document-sharing network. By adding a few header tags to research papers, the message claimed, one could publish them in such a way that scientists in other labs all around the world could access them easily. I hadn\u0027t written anything worth reading yet, and I\u0027d already read enough cryptic research papers for one night, so I deleted the e-mail and starting searching the file server for cool games. That was around April or May of 1993. About that same time, www.mit.edu went online as one of the first 100 web servers in the world. Naturally, this was not MIT\u0027s official homepage(2), because at that point, nobody had homepages. It was actually a server set up by a bunch of students that collectively called themselves SIPB (the Student Information Processing Board). Their pages provided a central starting place for exploring MIT\u0027s web sites, providing helpful information for \"surfers\" who were still confused by the whole concept.(3) Bow down and give thanks to Archie The grandfather of all search engines was Archie, created in 1990 by Alan Emtage, a student at McGill University in Montreal. The author originally wanted to call the program \"archives,\" but had to shorten it to comply with the Unix world standard of assigning programs and files short, cryptic names such as grep, cat, troff, sed, awk, perl, and so on. For more information on where Archie is today, see: http://www.bunyip.com/products/archie/ At the early date of 1990, there was no World Wide Web. Around this time, Tim Burners-Lee probably had a bad dream in which a scary monster with \"HTTP\" etched into its hide slowly ate up all of the Earth\u0027s resources. Nonetheless, there was still an Internet, and many files were scattered all over the vast network. The primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This was (and still is) a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the Internet. It works like this: Some administrator decides that he wants to make files available from his computer. He sets up a program on his computer, called an FTP server. When someone on the Internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer, he or she connects to it via another program called an FTP client. Any FTP client program can connect with any FTP server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the FTP protocol. Initially, anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an FTP server in order to make the file available to others. Later, \"anonymous\" FTP sites became repositories for files, allowing all users to post and retrieve them. Even with archive sites, many important files were still scattered on small FTP servers. Unfortunately, these files could be located only by the Internet equivalent of word of mouth: Somebody would post an e-mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file. Archie changed all that. It combined a scr",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Software used to help develop a website or web application The Wikipedia Main Page being inspected using Firefox Web development tools (often abbreviated to dev tools) allow web developers to test, modify and debug their websites. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application. Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in modern web browsers. Browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera have built-in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download centers. Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. History and support [edit] Early web developers manually debugged their websites by commenting out code and using JavaScript functions. One of the first browser debugging tools to exist was Mozilla\u0027s Firebug extension, which possessed many of the current core features of today\u0027s developer tools, leading to Firefox becoming popular with developers at the time. Safari\u0027s WebKit engine also introduced its integrated developer tools around that period, which eventually became the basis for both Safari and Chrome\u0027s current tooling.[1][2][3] Microsoft released a developer toolbar for Internet Explorer 6 and 7; and then integrated them into the browser from version 8 onwards.[4][5] In 2017, Mozilla discontinued Firebug in favour of integrated developer tools.[6] Nowadays, all modern web browsers have support for web developer tools that allow web designers and developers to look at the make-up of their pages. These are all tools that are built into the browser and do not require additional modules or configuration.[7] Firefox – F12 opens the Firefox DevTools.[8] Google Chrome and Opera – Developer Tools (DevTools)[9][10] Microsoft Edge – F12 opens Web Developer Tools.[11][12] Microsoft incorporates additional features that are not included in mainline Chromium.[13] Safari – The Safari Web Inspector has to be enabled from its settings pane.[14][15][3] Features [edit] The built-in web developer tools in the browser are commonly accessed by hovering over an item on a webpage and selecting the \"Inspect Element\" or similar option from the context menu. Alternatively the F12 key tends to be another common shortcut.[7] HTML and the DOM [edit] HTML and DOM viewer and editor is commonly included in the built-in web development tools. The difference between the HTML and DOM viewer, and the view source feature in web browsers is that the HTML and DOM viewer allows you to see the DOM as it was rendered in addition to allowing you to make changes to the HTML and DOM and see the change reflected in the page after the change is made.[16][3][7] In addition to selecting and editing, the HTML elements panels will usually also display properties of the DOM object, such as display dimension, and CSS properties.[17] Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge all allow users to simulate the document on a mobile device by modifying the viewport dimensions and pixel density.[18] Additionally, Firefox and Chrome both have the option to simulate colour blindness for the page.[19] Web page assets, resources and network information [edit] Web pages typically load and require additional content in the form of images, scripts, font and other external files. Web development tools also allow developers to inspect resources that are loaded and available on the web page in a tree-structure listing, and the appearance of style sheets can be tested in real time.[20][21][7] Web development tools also allow developers to view information about the network usage, such as viewing what the loading time and bandwidth usage are and which HTTP headers are being sent and received.[22] Developers can manipulate and resend network requests.[23][18] Profiling and auditing [edit] Profiling allows developers to capture information about the performance of a web page or web application. With this information developers can improve the performance of their scripts. Auditing features may provide developers suggestions, after analyzing a page, for optimizations to decrease page load time and increase responsiveness. Web development tools typically also provide a record of the time it takes to render the page, memory usage, and the types of events which are taking place.[24][25][3] These features allow developers to optimize their web page or web application.[26] JavaScript debugging [edit] JavaScript is commonly used in web browsers.[16] Web development tools commonly include a debugger panel for scripts by allowing developers to add watch expressions, breakpoints, view the call stack, and",

History [edit] Following its 2020 founding, You.com opened its public beta on November 9, 2021,[8] and received $20 million in funding led by Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff.[6][9] Other investors include Breyer Capital, Sound Ventures, and Day One Ventures.[10] The domain You.com was initially purchased in 1996 by Benioff.[11] Benioff invested in You.com and transferred ownership of the You.com domain name to the company.[10] In July 2022, You.com announced its $25 million Series A funding round led by Radical Ventures[12] with participation from Time Ventures, Breyer Capital, Norwest Venture Partners and Day One Ventures.[13] In September 2024, You.com raised $50 million in Series B funding led by Georgian.[14] In September 2025, You.com raised $100 million in Series C funding led by Cox Enterprises at a $1.5 billion valuation, achieving unicorn status.[1] Business Model [edit] You.com generates revenue primarily through enterprise sales of search APIs and AI tools. The platform provides web search capabilities that can be integrated into enterprise applications and AI agents.[15][16] Features [edit] On December 23, 2022, You.com was the first search engine to launch a ChatGPT-style chatbot with live web results alongside its responses.[17][18][19] Initially known as YouChat,[20] the chatbot was primarily based on the GPT-3.5 large language model and could answer questions, suggest ideas,[21] translate text,[22] summarize articles, compose emails, and write code snippets, while staying up-to-date with current events [19] and citing sources. Several further versions of YouChat were released. The second version, called YouChat 2.0, was released on February 7, 2023,[23][24] incorporated improved conversational AI[25] and community-built applications by blending a large language model named C-A-L (Chat, Apps, and Links).[25][20] This update enabled YouChat to provide results in various formats, such as charts,[26] photos,[27] videos, tables, graphs, text or code, so users can find answers without leaving the search results page. YouChat 3.0, unveiled on May 4, 2023,[28] combined chat functionality with results from Reddit, TikTok, Stack Overflow and Wikipedia. YouPro [edit] On June 21, 2023, You.com introduced YouPro, a paid subscription.[29] Both free and paid versions provide access to large language models connected to the internet with citation capabilities.[30] ARI [edit] In February 2025, You.com launched ARI (Advanced Research and Insights), a deep research agent that scans over 400 sources simultaneously to produce research reports with verified citations and interactive graphs, charts, and visualizations.[31] The platform targets regulated industries where comprehensive source verification is critical, with customers including healthcare publishers and advisory firms.[32] Reception [edit] You.com was named one of TIME\u0027s Best Inventions of 2022.[33][34] You.com\u0027s ARI (Advanced Research \u0026 Insights) feature was named one of TIME\u0027s Best Inventions of 2025.[35] References [edit] ^ a b Zaveri, Paayal (September 3, 2025). \"You.com Becomes a Unicorn, Shifts Away From Search Engine Plans\".

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Multimedia search enables information search using queries in multiple data types including text and other multimedia formats. Multimedia search can be implemented through multimodal search interfaces, i.e., interfaces that allow to submit search queries not only as textual requests, but also through other media. We can distinguish two methodologies in multimedia search: Metadata search: the search is made on the layers of metadata. Query by example: The interaction consists in submitting a piece of information (e.g., a video, an image, or a piece of audio) for the purpose of finding similar multimedia items. Metadata search [edit] Search is made using the layers in metadata which contain information of the content of a multimedia file. Metadata search is easier, faster and effective because instead of working with complex material, such as an audio, a video or an image, it searches using text. There are three processes which should be done in this method: Summarization of media content (feature extraction). The result of feature extraction is a description. Filtering of media descriptions (for example, elimination of Redundancy) Categorization of media descriptions into classes. Query by example [edit] In query by example, the element used to search is a multimedia content (image, audio, video). In other words, the query is a media. Often, it\u0027s used audiovisual indexing. It will be necessary to choose the criteria we are going to use for creating metadata. The process of search can be divided in three parts: Generate descriptors for the media which we are going to use as query and the descriptors for the media in our database. Compare descriptors of the query and our database’s media. List the media sorted by maximum coincidence. Multimedia search engine [edit] There are two big search families, in function of the content: Visual search engine Audio search engine Visual search engine [edit] Inside this family we can distinguish two topics: image search and video search Image search: Although usually it\u0027s used simple metadata search, increasingly is being used indexing methods for making the results of users queries more accurate using query by example. For example, QR codes. Video search: Videos can be searched for simple metadata or by complex metadata generated by indexing. The audio contained in the videos is usually scanned by audio search engines. Audio search engine [edit] There are different methods of audio searching: Voice search engine: Allows the user to search using speech instead of text. It uses algorithms of speech recognition. An example of this technology is Google Voice Search.[1] Music search engine: Although most of applications which searches music works on simple metadata (artist, name of track, album…) . There are some programs of music recognition, for example Shazam[2] or SoundHound.

History [edit] Early history [edit] Ixquick was created in 1998 by David Bodnick in New York City.[6] Initially, it provided metasearch for 14 different web and directory search engines as well as images, news, and MP3 engines.[7] Results were sorted after evaluating how relevant each of the search tools found the query.[8] Surfboard Holding BV, a company based in Zeist, Netherlands, and led by CEO Robert E. G. Beens, acquired Ixquick in 2000.[9] Ixquick was re-launched on 23 March 2005 with new features including a redesigned metasearch algorithm.[6][10] The Ixquick webpage as it appeared in 2001 Startpage.com began as a web directory on January 28th, 1998[11] and started mirroring Ixquick in 2003.[12] On 7 July 2009, the company re-launched Startpage.com to fetch results only from the Google search engine.[13] Prior to the release of Tor Browser version 4.5 in April 2015, Startpage.com was its default search engine.[14] Merger and recent history [edit] On 29 March 2016, Ixquick.com was merged into the Startpage.com search engine. However, Ixquick was still available at Ixquick.eu, Ixquick.info and the Ixquick Search App until 2nd of April 2018, when they were discontinued.[15][16][17] As of 2017, Startpage fields an estimated 2 billion searches[quantify]. The company was one of 200 European companies that opposed the F.C.C. implementation of policies ending net neutrality.[18] In October 2019, Privacy One Group, owned by adtech company System1, acquired a majority stake in Startpage. An initial lack of transparency surrounding the deal caused some concern among privacy researchers, leading to its removal from the PrivacyTools review website.[19][20] After responding to questions from PrivacyTools team members, Startpage was able to clarify that the acquisition would not impact their privacy-focused mission, and its recommendation was ultimately restored.[21][22] According to the company, its \"founders may unilaterally reject any potential technical change that could negatively affect user privacy\".[23][24] By maintaining its headquarters and operations in the Netherlands, Startpage continues to be protected by Dutch and European Union (EU) privacy laws.[25] In May 2020, Vivaldi announced that its browser had added Startpage as an optional or default search engine.[26][27] Products [edit] On 27 June 2006, following criticism of Google Shopping, the website began to delete private details of its users.[28] Ixquick stated that it does not share the personal information of users with other search engines or with the provider of its sponsored results.[29][30] According to The New York Times\u0027 Wirecutter, Startpage does not store user\u0027s personal information or search data.[31] A May 2020 review of the website on ZDNet also states that Startpage \"does not track, log, or share data or searching history\".[32] In 2011, Startpage received the European Privacy Seal, a European Union–sponsored initiative that indicates compliance with EU laws and regulations on data security and privacy through a series of design and technical audits. It was re-certified in 2013 and 2015.[33] The company has also completely ended the recording of user IP addresses since January 2009.[34] Because Startpage is based in the Netherlands, it is also \"not subject to US laws like the Patriot Act, and cannot be forced to comply with US dragnet surveillance programs, like PRISM.\"[35] Startpage has also contributed €20,000 to NOYB, the non-profit organization founded by Max Schrems, which is committed to launching strategic court cases and media initiatives in support of the EU\u0027s General Data Protection Regulation.[32] The company also provides a stand-alone proxy service, Startpage.com Proxy, which is incorporated into the Startpage search engine.[36] This feature, known as Anonymous View since 2018, allows users the option to open all search res",

This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called \"hard news\" to differentiate it from soft media. Subject matters for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, economy, business, fashion, sport, entertainment, and the environment, as well as quirky or unusual events. Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. Throughout history, people have transported new information through oral means. Having developed in China over centuries, newspapers became established in Europe during the early modern period. In the 20th century, radio and television became an important means of transmitting news. Whilst in the 21st century, the internet has also begun to play a similar role. Meaning [edit] Etymology [edit] The English word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In Middle English, the equivalent word was newes, like the French nouvelles. Similar developments are found in the Slavic languages – namely cognates from Serbo-Croatian novost (from nov, \"new\"), Czech and Slovak noviny (from nový, \"new\"), the Polish nowiny (pronounced noviney), the Bulgarian novini and Russian novosti – and likewise in the Celtic languages: the Welsh newyddion (from newydd) and the Cornish nowodhow (from nowydh).[1][2] Jessica Garretson Finch is credited with coining the phrase \"current events\" while teaching at Barnard College in the 1890s.[3] Newness [edit] As its name implies, \"news\" typically connotes the presentation of new information.[4][5] The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.[5][6][7] Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.[8] News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even",

Collaboration partners do so by providing query terms, collective tagging, adding comments or opinions, rating search results, and links clicked of former (successful) IR activities to users having the same or a related information need. Models of collaboration [edit] Collaborative search engines can be classified along several dimensions: intent (explicit and implicit) and synchronization,[1] depth of mediation,[2] task vs. trait,[3] division of labor, and sharing of knowledge.[4] Explicit vs. implicit collaboration [edit] Implicit collaboration characterizes Collaborative filtering and recommendation systems in which the system infers similar information needs. I-Spy,[5] Jumper 2.0, Seeks, the Community Search Assistant,[6] the CSE of Burghardt et al.,[7] and the works of Longo et al. [8] [9] [10] all represent examples of implicit collaboration. Systems that fall under this category identify similar users, queries and links clicked automatically, and recommend related queries and links to the searchers. Explicit collaboration means that users share an agreed-upon information need and work together toward that goal. For example, in a chat-like application, query terms and links clicked are automatically exchanged. The most prominent example of this class is SearchTogether[11] published in 2007. SearchTogether offers an interface that combines search results from standard search engines and a chat to exchange queries and links. PlayByPlay[12] takes a step further to support general purpose collaborative browsing tasks with an instant messaging functionality. Reddy et al.[13] follow a similar approach and compares two implementations of their CSE called MUSE and MUST. Reddy et al. focus on the role of communication required for efficient CSEs. Cerciamo [2] supports explicit collaboration by allowing one person to concentrate on finding promising groups of documents while having the other person make in-depth judgments of relevance on documents found by the first person. However, in Papagelis et al.[14] terms are used differently: they combine explicitly shared links and implicitly collected browsing histories of users to a hybrid CSE. Community of practice [edit] Recent work in collaborative filtering and information retrieval has shown that sharing of search experiences among users having similar interests, typically called a community of practice or community of interest, reduces the effort put in by a given user in retrieving the exact information of interest.[15] Collaborative search deployed within a community of practice deploys novel techniques for exploiting context during search by indexing and ranking search results based on the learned preferences of a community of users.[16] The users benefit by sharing information, experiences and awareness to personalize result-lists to reflect the preferences of the community as a whole. The community representing a group of users who share common interests, similar professions. The best known example is the open-source project ApexKB (previously known as Jumper 2.0).[17] Depth of mediation [edit] The depth of mediation refers to the degree that the CSE mediates search.[2] SearchTogether[11] is an example of UI-level mediation: users exchange query results and judgments of relevance, but the system does not distinguish among users when they run queries. PlayByPlay[12] is another example of UI-level mediation where all users have full and equal access to the instant messaging functionality without the system\u0027s coordination. Cerchiamo[2] and recommendation systems such as I-Spy[5] keep track of each person\u0027s search activity independently and use that information to affect their search results. These are examples of deeper algorithmic mediation. Task vs. trait [edit] This model classifies people\u0027s membership in groups based on the task at hand vs. long-term interests; these may be correlated with explicit and implicit collaboration.[3] Platforms and modalities [edit] CSE systems started off on the desktop end, with the earliest ones being extensions or modifications to existing web",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from KidzSearch) Google search feature The filter for SafeSearch on Google. SafeSearch is a search feature on Google, and later, Microsoft Bing.[1] It is an automated filter of pornography, violence, gore, and other offensive or inappropriate content.[2] It is used as a parental control setting due to the feature being, most likely, to keep children from harmful content. History [edit] On November 11th, 2009, Google introduced the ability for users with Google Accounts to lock on the SafeSearch level in Google\u0027s web and image searches. Once configured, a password is required to change the setting.[3] On December 12, 2012, Google removed the option to turn off the filter entirely, requiring users to enter more specific search queries to access adult content.[4][5][6] SafeSearch can be enforced by local area network administrators and ISPs by adding a DNS record. This is often done on school networks to prevent students from accessing pornographic content.[7][8] Users themselves can turn this setting on to filter out any inappropriate content.[9] Effectiveness [edit] A report by Harvard Law School\u0027s Berkman Center for Internet \u0026 Society stated that SafeSearch excluded many innocuous websites from search-result listings, including ones created by the White House, IBM, the American Library Association and Liz Claiborne.[10] On the other hand, many pornographic images slip through the filter, even when \"innocent\" search terms are entered. Blacklisting certain search terms is hindered by homographs (e.g., \"beaver\"),[11] blacklisting certain URLs is rendered ineffective by the changing URLs of porn sites, and software to tag images with copious amounts of flesh tones as pornographic content is problematic because there are a variety of skin tones and pictures of babies tend to have a lot of flesh tones.[12] Google\u0027s ability to filter porn has been an important factor in its relationship with the People\u0027s Republic of China.[13] References [edit] ^ \"Enforcing Bing SafeSearch | Tech Lockdown\". www.techlockdown.com.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Cache of web pages The link for the cached version of a web page in search results from Google (top), Bing (middle) and Yandex (bottom) A search engine cache is a cache of web pages that shows the page as it was when it was indexed by a web crawler. Cached versions of web pages can be used to view the contents of a page when the live version cannot be reached, has been altered or taken down.[1] A web crawler collects the contents of a web page, which is then indexed by a web search engine. The search engine might make the copy accessible to users. Web crawlers that obey restrictions in robots.txt[2] or meta tags[3] by the site webmaster may not make a cached copy available to search engine users if instructed not to. Search engine caches can be used for crime investigation,[4] legal proceedings[5] and journalism.[6][1] They may not be fully protected by the usual laws that protect technology providers from copyright infringement claims.[7] Google Cache [edit] Google retired its web caching service in 2024.[8] The service was designed for websites that might show up in a Google search result, but are temporarily offline. As a \"cache\", it was not designed for archival purposes, the cache had expiration. Google said the Internet as of 2024 is much more reliable than it was \"way back\" in earlier days, and therefore its cache service is no longer an important service to maintain.[8] Google pointed to the Wayback Machine as a better alternative, and suggested Google might work with them in the future.[8] In September 2024, Google and the Internet Archive announced a collaboration providing links to the Wayback Machine from within Google Search.[9] Bing Search [edit] Bing Search, following Google Cache\u0027s lead, also retired its web caching service in late 2024. Microsoft explained, \"the internet has evolved for better reliability, and many pages aren\u0027t optimized for cache viewing.\"[10][11] Yahoo! Search [edit] Yahoo! Search began offering a cache service in May 2011.[12] After Google Cache was eliminated in early 2024, PC Mag reported that alternative sites Bing and Yahoo! Search were still available for caching. It noted that as long as Bing cache worked, Yahoo! Search would also, since Microsoft (Bing) is the crawling service for Yahoo. Bing cache ceased working late in 2024, and Yahoo Cache buttons are no longer available. There was no official announcement from Yahoo about the cache service being eliminated.[13] References [edit] ^ a b Wilfried Ruetten (2012). The Data Journalism Handbook. O\u0027Reilly Media, Inc.

Please refer to the current edition of the \"Internet\n   Official Protocol Standards\" (STD 1) for the standardization state\n   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n\nCopyright Notice\n\n   Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2004).\n\nAbstract\n\n   This document updates the specification of the WHOIS protocol,\n   thereby obsoleting RFC 954.  The update is intended to remove the\n   material from RFC 954 that does not have to do with the on-the-wire\n   protocol, and is no longer applicable in today\u0027s Internet.  This\n   document does not attempt to change or update the protocol per se, or\n   document other uses of the protocol that have come into existence\n   since the publication of RFC 954.\n\n1.  Introduction\n\n   WHOIS is a TCP-based transaction-oriented query/response protocol\n   that is widely used to provide information services to Internet\n   users.  While originally used to provide \"white pages\" services and\n   information about registered domain names, current deployments cover\n   a much broader range of information services.  The protocol delivers\n   its content in a human-readable format.  This document updates the\n   specification of the WHOIS protocol, thereby obsoleting RFC 954 [1].\n\n   For historic reasons, WHOIS lacks many of the protocol design\n   attributes, for example internationalisation and strong security,\n   that would be expected from any recently-designed IETF protocol.\n   This document does not attempt to rectify any of those shortcomings.\n   Instead, this memo documents the WHOIS protocol as it is.  In some\n   areas, this document does document particular well known shortcomings\n   of the WHOIS protocol.  The discussion of possible protocols to carry\n   out these functions, with updated capabilities to address the\n\n\n\nDaigle                      Standards Track                     [Page 1] \nRFC 3912              WHOIS Protocol Specification        September 2004\n\n\n   shortcomings, is being addressed in a separate IETF activity (CRISP\n   Working Group).\n\n2.  Protocol Specification\n\n   A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for requests from WHOIS\n   clients.  The WHOIS client makes a text request to the WHOIS server,\n   then the WHOIS server replies with text content.  All requests are\n   terminated with ASCII CR and then ASCII LF.  The response might\n   contain more than one line of text, so the presence of ASCII CR or\n   ASCII LF characters does not indicate the end of the response.  The\n   WHOIS server closes its connection as soon as the output is finished.\n   The closed TCP connection is the indication to the client that the\n   response has been received.\n\n3.  Protocol Example\n\n   If one places a request of the WHOIS server located at whois.nic.mil\n   for information about \"Smith\", the packets on the wire will look\n   like:\n\n   client                           server at whois.nic.mil\n\n   open TCP   ---- (SYN) ------------------------------\u003e\n              \u003c---- (SYN+ACK) -------------------------\n   send query ---- \"Smith\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e\" --------------------\u003e\n   get answer \u003c---- \"Info about Smith\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e\" ---------\n              \u003c---- \"More info about Smith\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e\" ----\n   close      \u003c---- (FIN) ------------------------------\n              ----- (FIN) -----------------------------\u003e\n\n4.  Internationalisation\n\n   The WHOIS protocol has not been internationalised.  The WHOIS\n   protocol has no mechanism for indicating the character set in use.\n   Originally, the predominant text encoding in use was US-ASCII.  In\n   practice, some WHOIS servers, particularly those outside the USA,\n   might be using some other character set either for requests, replies,\n   or both.  This inability to predict or express text encoding has\n   adversely impacted the interoperability (and, therefore, usefulness)\n   of the WHOIS protocol.\n\n5.  Security Considerations\n\n   The WHOIS protocol has no provisions for strong security.  WHOIS\n   lacks mechanisms for access control, integrity, and confidentiality.\n   Accordingly, WHOIS-based services should only be used for information\n   which is non-sensitive and intended to be accessible to everyone.\n\n\n\nDaigle                      Standards Track                     [Page 2] \nRFC 3912              WHOIS Protocol Specification        September 2004\n\n\n   The absence of such security mechanisms means this protocol would not\n   normally be acceptable to the IETF at the time of this writing.\n\n6.

Find sources: \"Search engine\" computing – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this message) In computing, a search engine is an information retrieval software system designed to help find information stored on one or more computer systems. Search engines discover, crawl, transform, and store information for retrieval and presentation in response to user queries. The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called hits. The most widely used type of search engine is a web search engine, which searches for information on the World Wide Web. A search engine normally consists of four components, as follows: a search interface, a crawler (also known as a spider or bot), an indexer, and a database. The crawler traverses a document collection, deconstructs document text, and assigns surrogates for storage in the search engine index. Online search engines store images, link data and metadata for the document. How search engines work [edit] Search engines provide an interface to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items. The criteria are referred to as a search query. In the case of text search engines, the search query is typically expressed as a set of words that identify the desired concept that one or more documents may contain.[1] There are several styles of search query syntax that vary in strictness. It can also switch names within the search engines from previous sites. Whereas some text search engines require users to enter two or three words separated by white space, other search engines may enable users to specify entire documents, pictures, sounds, and various forms of natural language. Some search engines apply improvements to search queries to increase the likelihood of providing a quality set of items through a process known as query expansion. Query understanding methods can be used as standardized query language. Index-based search engine The list of items that meet the criteria specified by the query is typically sorted, or ranked. Ranking items by relevance (from highest to lowest) reduces the time required to find the desired information. Probabilistic search engines rank items based on measures of similarity (between each item and the query, typically on a scale of 1 to 0, 1 being most similar) and sometimes popularity or authority (see Bibliometrics) or use relevance feedback. Boolean search engines typically only return items which match exactly without regard to order, although the term Boolean search engine may simply refer to the use of Boolean-style syntax (the use of operators AND, OR, NOT, and XOR) in a probabilistic context. To provide a set of matching items that are sorted according to some criteria quickly, a search engine will typically collect metadata about the group of items under consideration beforehand through a process referred to as indexing. The index typically requires a smaller amount of computer storage, which is why some search engines only store the indexed information and not the full content of each item, and instead provide a method of navigating to the items in the search engine result page. Alternatively, the search engine may store a copy of each item in a cache so that users can see the state of the item at the time it was indexed or for archive purposes or to make repetitive processes work more efficiently and quickly.[2] Other types of search engines do not store an index. Crawler, or spider type search engines (a.k.a. real-time search engines) may collect and assess items at the time of the search query, dynamically considering additional items based on the contents of a starting item (known as a seed, or seed URL in the case of an Internet crawler). Meta search engines store neither an index nor a cache and instead simply reuse the index or results of one or more other search engine to provide an aggregated, final set of results. Database size, which had been a significant marketing feature through the early 2000s, was similarly displaced by emphasis on relevancy ranking, the methods by which search engines attempt to sort the best results first. Relevancy ranking first became a major issue c. 1996, w",

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science. In response to American industrialization, William Barton Rogers organized a school in Boston to create \"useful knowledge.\" Initially funded by a federal land grant, the institute adopted a polytechnic model that stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT moved from Boston to Cambridge in 1916 and grew rapidly through collaboration with private industry, military branches, and new federal basic research agencies, the formation of which was influenced by MIT faculty like Vannevar Bush. In the late twentieth century, MIT became a leading center for research in computer science, digital technology, artificial intelligence and big science initiatives like the Human Genome Project. Engineering remains its largest school, though MIT has also built programs in basic science, social sciences, business management, and humanities. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) along the Charles River. The campus is known for academic buildings interconnected by corridors and many significant modernist buildings. MIT\u0027s off-campus operations include the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes. The institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies.[10][11] As of October 2024[update], 105 Nobel laureates,[12] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[13] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[14] 83 Marshall Scholars,[15] 41 astronauts,[16] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and 8 foreign heads of state have been affiliated with MIT. History [edit] Main article: History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Foundation and vision [edit] [...] a school of industrial science aiding the advancement, development and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce [...][17] — Massachusetts General Court, Acts of 1861, Chapter 183 In 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a \"Conservatory of Art and Science\", but the proposal failed.[18][19] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.[20] Rogers, a geologist who had recently arrived in Boston from the University of Virginia,[21] wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.[22][23] He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education,[24] proposing that: The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.[25] The Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.[26][27] Early developments [edit] Original Rog",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Investigative data-analysis technique See also: Open-source intelligence In network theory, link analysis is a data-analysis technique used to evaluate relationships between nodes. Relationships may be identified among various types of nodes, including organizations, people and transactions. Link analysis has been used for investigation of criminal activity (fraud, counterterrorism, and intelligence), computer security analysis, search engine optimization, market research, medical research, and art. Knowledge discovery [edit] Knowledge discovery is an iterative and interactive process used to identify, analyze and visualize patterns in data.[1] Network analysis, link analysis and social network analysis are all methods of knowledge discovery, each a corresponding subset of the prior method. Most knowledge discovery methods follow these steps (at the highest level):[2] Data processing Transformation Analysis Visualization Data gathering and processing requires access to data and has several inherent issues, including information overload and data errors. Once data is collected, it will need to be transformed into a format that can be effectively used by both human and computer analyzers. Manual or computer-generated visualizations tools may be mapped from the data, including network charts. Several algorithms exist to help with analysis of data – Dijkstra\u0027s algorithm, breadth-first search, and depth-first search. Link analysis focuses on analysis of relationships among nodes through visualization methods (network charts, association matrix). Here is an example of the relationships that may be mapped for crime investigations:[3] Relationship/Network Data Sources 1. Trust Prior contacts in family, neighborhood, school, military, club or organization. Public and court records. Data may only be available in suspect\u0027s native country. 2. Task Logs and records of phone calls, electronic mail, chat rooms, instant messages, Web site visits. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. 3. Money \u0026 Resources Bank account and money transfer records. Pattern and location of credit card use. Prior court records. Human intelligence: observation of visits to alternate banking resources such as Hawala. 4. Strategy \u0026 Goals Web sites. Videos and encrypted disks delivered by courier. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. Link analysis is used for 3 primary purposes:[4] Find matches in data for known patterns of interest; Find anomalies where known patterns are violated; Discover new patterns of interest (social network analysis, data mining). History [edit] Klerks categorized link analysis tools into 3 generations.[5] The first generation was introduced in 1975 as the Anacpapa Chart of Harper and Harris.[6] This method requires that a domain expert review data files, identify associations by constructing an association matrix, create a link chart for visualization and finally analyze the network chart to identify patterns of interest. This method requires extensive domain knowledge and is extremely time-consuming when reviewing vast amounts of data. Association Matrix In addition to the association matrix, the activities matrix can be used to produce actionable information, which has practical value and use to law-enforcement. The activities matrix, as the term might imply, centers on the actions and activities of people with respect to locations. Whereas the association matrix focuses on the relationships between people, organizations, and/or properties. The distinction between these two types of matrices, while minor, is nonetheless significant in terms of the output of the analysis completed or rendered.[7][8][9][10] Second generation tools consist of automatic graphics-based analysis tools such as IBM i2 Analyst\u0027s Notebook, Netmap, ClueMaker and Watson. These tools offer the ability to automate the construction and updates of the link chart once an association matrix is manually created, however, analysis of the resulting charts and graphs still requires an expert with extensive domain knowledge. The third generation of link-analysis tools like DataWalk allow the automatic visualization of linkages between elements in a data set, that can then serve as the canvas for further exploration or manual updates.

Founded in 1821 by royal charter,[11] the university bears the name of James McGill, a Scottish merchant,[12] whose bequest in 1813 established the University of McGill College. In 1885, the name of the university was officially changed to McGill University. McGill has an enrolment of more than 39,000 students. Its main campus is on the slope of Mount Royal in downtown Montreal in the borough of Ville-Marie, with a second campus situated in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the main campus on Montreal Island. The university is one of two members of the Association of American Universities located outside the United States,[13] alongside the University of Toronto, and is the only Canadian member of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF) within the World Economic Forum.[14] The university offers degrees and diplomas in over 300 fields of study. Most students are enrolled in the six largest faculties: Arts, Science, Medicine, Education, Engineering, and Management.[15] McGill alumni, faculty, and affiliates include 15 Nobel laureates,[16] 149 Rhodes Scholars,[17] 1 Turing Award winner, 3 prime ministers of Canada, 2 governors general of Canada, 9 foreign leaders, and 14 justices of the Supreme Court of Canada. McGill alumni also include 9 Academy Award winners,[note 1] 13 Grammy Award winners,[note 2] 15 Emmy Award winners,[note 3] 4 Pulitzer Prize winners,[note 4] and 121 Olympians with over 35 Olympic medals.[20][ambiguous] History Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning James McGill, the original benefactor of McGill University The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning (RIAL) was created in 1801 under an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (41 George III Chapter 17), An Act for the establishment of Free Schools and the Advancement of Learning in this Province.[21] The RIAL was initially authorized to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This was a turning point for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, which showed the government\u0027s willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first step in the creation of non-denominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813, his bequest was administered by the RIAL. In 1846, the Royal Grammar School in Quebec City closed, and the one in Montreal merged with the High School of Montreal. By the mid-19th century, the RIAL had lost control of the other eighty-two grammar schools it had administered.[22] However, in 1853 it took over the High School of Montreal from the school\u0027s board of directors and continued to operate it until 1870.[23][24] Thereafter, its sole remaining purpose was to administer the McGill bequest on behalf of the private college. The RIAL continues to exist today; it is the corporate identity that runs the university and its various constituent bodies, including the former Macdonald College (now Macdonald Campus), the Montreal Neurological Institute, and the Royal Victoria College (the former women\u0027s college turned residence). Since the revised Royal Charter of 1852, the trustees of the RIAL are the board of governors of McGill University.[11] McGill College The first Principal of McGill College, The Rt. Rev.

    "content": "Web Data Mining Exploring Hyperlinks, Contents, and Usage Data Bing Liu, Second Edition, July 2011 First Edition, Dec 2006, Springer Second Edition First Edition Web mining aims to discover useful knowledge from Web hyperlinks, page content and usage log. Based on the primary kind of data used in the mining process, Web mining tasks are categorized into three main types: Web structure mining, Web content mining and Web usage mining. This book consists of two parts. The first part covers the data mining and machine learning foundations, where all the essential algorithms of data mining and machine learning are presented. The second part covers the key topics of Web mining, where Web crawling, search, social network analysis, structured data extraction, information integration, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, Web usage mining, query log mining, computational advertising, and recommender systems are all treated in breadth and in depth (the SVD matrix factorization algorithm of Simon Funk used in Netflix Prize Contest is described in detail). What is new in the second edition? Most chapters have been updated. The major changes are in Chapter 11 and Chapter 12, which have been re-written and significantly expanded. When the first edition was written, opinion mining (Chapter 11) was still in its infancy. Since then, the research community has proposed many novel techniques to solve various aspects of the problem. To include the latest developments for the Web usage mining chapter (Chapter 12), the topics of recommender systems and collaborative filtering, query log mining, and computational advertising have been added. This new edition is thus considerably longer, from a total of 532 pages in the first edition to a total of 622 pages in this second edition. Teaching and Learning: Although the book is titled \"Web Data Mining\", it also covers the key topics of data mining, information retrieval, and text mining. Thus, it is suitable for a data mining course, in which the students learn not only data mining, but also Web mining and text mining. The book is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers and practioners in the field. No prior knowledge of data mining or machine learning is assumed.

The service traces its roots back to Microsoft\u0027s earlier search engines, including MSN Search, Windows Live Search, and Live Search. Bing offers a broad spectrum of search services, encompassing web, video, image, and map search products, all developed using ASP.NET. The transition from Live Search to Bing was announced by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California. The official release followed on June 3, 2009. Bing introduced several notable features at its inception, such as search suggestions during query input and a list of related searches, known as the \u0027Explore pane\u0027. These features leveraged semantic technology from Powerset, a company Microsoft acquired in 2008. Microsoft also struck a deal with Yahoo! that led to Bing powering Yahoo! Search. Microsoft made significant strides towards open-source technology in 2016, making the BitFunnel search engine indexing algorithm and various components of Bing open source. In February 2023, Microsoft launched Bing Chat (later renamed Microsoft Copilot), an artificial intelligence chatbot experience based on GPT-4, integrated directly into the search engine. This was well-received, with Bing reaching 100 million active users by the following month. As of April 2024, Bing holds the position of the second-largest search engine worldwide, with a market share of 3.64%, behind Google\u0027s 90.91%. Other competitors include Yandex with 1.61%, Baidu with 1.15%, and Yahoo!, which is largely powered by Bing, with 1.13%.[6] Approximately 27.43% of Bing\u0027s monthly global traffic comes from China, 22.16% from the United States, 4.85% from Japan, 4.18% from Germany and 3.61% from France.[7] History Background (1998–2009) MSN Search MSN Search homepage in 2002 MSN Search homepage in 2006 Microsoft launched MSN Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from Inktomi. It consisted of a search engine, index, and web crawler. In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version which displayed listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instead. Microsoft decided to make a large investment in web search by building its own web crawler for MSN Search, the index of which was updated weekly and sometimes daily. The upgrade started as a beta program in November 2004, and came out of beta in February 2005.[8] This occurred a year after rival Yahoo! Search rolled out its own crawler. Image search was powered by a third party, Picsearch. The service also started providing its search results to other search engine portals in an effort to better compete in the market. Windows Live Search Windows Live Search homepage The first public beta of Windows Live Search was unveiled on March 8, 2006, with the final release on September 11, 2006 replacing MSN Search. The new search engine used search tabs that include Web, news, images, music, desktop, local, and Microsoft Encarta. In the roll-over from MSN Search to Windows Live Search, Microsoft stopped using Picsearch as their image search provider and started performing their own image search, fueled by their own internal image search algorithms.[9] Live Search Live Search homepage, which would help to create the Bing homepage later on On March 21, 2007, Microsoft announced that it would separate its search developments from the Windows Live services family, rebranding the service as Live Search. Live Search was integrated into the Live Search and Ad Platform headed by Satya Nadella, part of Microsoft\u0027s Platform and Systems division. As part of this change, Live Search was merged with Microsoft adCenter.[10] A series of reorganizations and consolidations of Microsoft\u0027s search offerings were made under the Live Search brandi",

    "title": "Privacy concerns with Google - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Scroogle) Privacy concerns with Google include a wide range of issues and controversies related to collection, use, and sharing of user data across Google products, services, and platforms, including Google Search. Since the mid-2000s, civil liberties organizations and government regulators have criticized and taken action against Google related to Internet privacy issues in its data collection and data retention policies, web tracking practices, cooperation with intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies, and other activities. These concerns are a frequent theme in criticism of Google. History [edit] In 2007, Privacy International raised concerns regarding the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of Internet users\u0027 searches, and how under controversial existing U.S. law, Google can be forced to hand over all such information to the U.S. government.[1] In its 2007 Consultation Report, Privacy International ranked Google as \"Hostile to Privacy\", its lowest rating on their report, making Google the only company in the list to receive that ranking.[1][2][3] Around December 2009, after privacy concerns were raised, Google\u0027s CEO Eric Schmidt declared: \"If you have something that you don\u0027t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u0027t be doing it in the first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines—including Google—do retain this information for some time and it\u0027s important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.\"[4] At the Techonomy conference in 2010, Eric Schmidt predicted that \"true transparency and no anonymity\" is the path to take for the Internet: \"In a world of asynchronous threats it is too dangerous for there not to be some way to identify you. We need a [verified] name service for people. Governments will demand it.\" He also said that: \"If I look at enough of your messaging and your location, and use artificial intelligence, we can predict where you are going to go. Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don\u0027t have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You\u0027ve got Facebook photos!\"[5] Google\u0027s changes to its privacy policy on March 16, 2012, enabled the company to share data across a wide variety of services.[6] These embedded services include millions of third-party websites that use AdSense and Analytics. The policy was widely criticized for creating an environment that discourages Internet innovation by making Internet users more fearful and wary of what they do online.[7] In the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google\u0027s privacy policy was changed to state it \"may\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the \"Activity controls\" in the \"My Account\" page of a Google account. ProPublica stated that \"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\" Google contacted ProPublica to correct the fact that it didn\u0027t \"currently\" use Gmail keywords to target web ads.[8] Shona Ghosh, a journalist for Business Insider, noted in 2019 that an increasing digital resistance movement against Google had grown.[9] A major hub for critics of Google in order to organize to abstain from using Google products is the Reddit page for the subreddit r/degoogle.[9] The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit organization which deals with civil liberties, raised concerns in 2018 regarding privacy issues pertaining to student data after conducting a survey which showed that a majority of parents, students and teachers are concerned that student privacy is being breached.[10] According to the EFF, the Federal Trade Commission has ignored complaints from the public that Google has been harvesting student data and search results even after holding talks with the Department of Education in 2018.[10][4] In 2019, Google blocked W3C privacy proposals using their veto power.[11] The W3C decides how the World Wide Web works, and Google vetoed a measure to expand W3C\u0027s power within its internet privacy group.[12] Potential for data disclosure [edit] Data leaks [edit] On March 10, 2009, Google reported that a bug in Google Docs had allowed unintended",

The service traces its roots back to Microsoft\u0027s earlier search engines, including MSN Search, Windows Live Search, and Live Search. Bing offers a broad spectrum of search services, encompassing web, video, image, and map search products, all developed using ASP.NET. The transition from Live Search to Bing was announced by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California. The official release followed on June 3, 2009. Bing introduced several notable features at its inception, such as search suggestions during query input and a list of related searches, known as the \u0027Explore pane\u0027. These features leveraged semantic technology from Powerset, a company Microsoft acquired in 2008. Microsoft also struck a deal with Yahoo! that led to Bing powering Yahoo! Search. Microsoft made significant strides towards open-source technology in 2016, making the BitFunnel search engine indexing algorithm and various components of Bing open source. In February 2023, Microsoft launched Bing Chat (later renamed Microsoft Copilot), an artificial intelligence chatbot experience based on GPT-4, integrated directly into the search engine. This was well-received, with Bing reaching 100 million active users by the following month. As of April 2024, Bing holds the position of the second-largest search engine worldwide, with a market share of 3.64%, behind Google\u0027s 90.91%. Other competitors include Yandex with 1.61%, Baidu with 1.15%, and Yahoo!, which is largely powered by Bing, with 1.13%.[6] Approximately 27.43% of Bing\u0027s monthly global traffic comes from China, 22.16% from the United States, 4.85% from Japan, 4.18% from Germany and 3.61% from France.[7] History Background (1998–2009) MSN Search MSN Search homepage in 2002 MSN Search homepage in 2006 Microsoft launched MSN Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from Inktomi. It consisted of a search engine, index, and web crawler. In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version which displayed listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instead. Microsoft decided to make a large investment in web search by building its own web crawler for MSN Search, the index of which was updated weekly and sometimes daily. The upgrade started as a beta program in November 2004, and came out of beta in February 2005.[8] This occurred a year after rival Yahoo! Search rolled out its own crawler. Image search was powered by a third party, Picsearch. The service also started providing its search results to other search engine portals in an effort to better compete in the market. Windows Live Search Windows Live Search homepage The first public beta of Windows Live Search was unveiled on March 8, 2006, with the final release on September 11, 2006 replacing MSN Search. The new search engine used search tabs that include Web, news, images, music, desktop, local, and Microsoft Encarta. In the roll-over from MSN Search to Windows Live Search, Microsoft stopped using Picsearch as their image search provider and started performing their own image search, fueled by their own internal image search algorithms.[9] Live Search Live Search homepage, which would help to create the Bing homepage later on On March 21, 2007, Microsoft announced that it would separate its search developments from the Windows Live services family, rebranding the service as Live Search. Live Search was integrated into the Live Search and Ad Platform headed by Satya Nadella, part of Microsoft\u0027s Platform and Systems division. As part of this change, Live Search was merged with Microsoft adCenter.[10] A series of reorganizations and consolidations of Microsoft\u0027s search offerings were made under the Live Search brandin",

For the subfield of computer science, see Analysis of algorithms. For other uses, see Algorithm (disambiguation). Flowchart of using successive subtractions to find the greatest common divisor of number r and s In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ⓘ) is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1] Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning). In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results.[2] For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called \"algorithms\", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly \"correct\" recommendation. As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[3] and in a well-defined formal language[4] for calculating a function.[5] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[6] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[7] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\"[8] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[9] Etymology [edit] Around 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī wrote kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī (\"Book of Indian computation\") and kitab al-jam\u0027 wa\u0027l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī (\"Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic\"). In the early 12th century, Latin translations of these texts involving the Hindu–Arabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared, for example Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice, attributed to John of Seville, and Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum, attributed to Adelard of Bath.[10] Here, alghoarismi or algorismi is the Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi\u0027s name;[1] the text starts with the phrase Dixit Algorismi, or \"Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi\".[2] The word algorism in English came to mean the use of place-value notation in calculations; it occurs in the Ancrene Wisse from circa 1225.[11] By the time Geoffrey Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century, he used a variant of the same word in describing augrym stones, stones used for place-value calculation.[12][13] In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός (arithmos, \"number\"; cf. \"arithmetic\"), the Latin word was altered to algorithmus.[14] By 1596, this form of the word was used in English, as algorithm, by Thomas Hood.[15] Definition [edit] For a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of \"algorithm\", see Algorithm characterizations. One informal definition is \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\",[16] which would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure[17] or cook-book recipe.[18] In general, a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventually[19]—even though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable. Boolos, Jeffrey \u0026 1974, 1999 define an algorithm to be an explicit set of instructions for determining an output, that can be followed by a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols.[20] Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain performing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or a mechanical device. History [edit] This section is missing information about 20th and 21st century development of computer algorithms. Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (October 2023) Ancient algorithms [edit] Step-by-step procedures for solving mathematical problems have been recorded since antiquity. This includes in Babylonian mathematics (around 2500 BC),[21] Egyptian mathematics (around 1550 BC),[21] Indian mathematics (around 800 BC and later),[22][23] the Ifa Oracle (around 500 BC),[24] Greek mathematics (around 240 BC),[25] Chinese mathematics (around 200 BC and later),[26] and Arabic mathematics (around 800 AD).[27] The earliest evidence of algorithms is found in ancient Mesopotamian mathematics. A Sumerian clay tablet found in Shuruppak near Baghdad and dated to c. 2500 BC describes the earliest division algorithm.[21] During the Hammurabi dynasty c. 18",

Alan Emtage invented the world\u0027s first search engine, but he didn\u0027t earn a single cent from his groundbreaking invention. \"I wrote a piece of code that gave birth to a multibillion-dollar industry,\" he tells The Huffington Post in an exclusive video interview. \"I didn\u0027t make any money off of it, but I wouldn\u0027t change anything.\" The self-proclaimed geek majored in computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and was working as a systems administrator for the School of Computer Science, where he was responsible for finding software for students and faculty. At the time, there was no other way to locate the software beyond a manual search through the directory archives, a \"tedious process\" that he decided to automate. Advertisement \"We built this very simple program that allowed people to do the search themselves,\" the native of Barbados says. The program needed a name, so Emtage called it \"Archie,\" which is \"archive\" without the V. Within months, half the internet traffic to Canada was going to the innovator\u0027s machine. \"At the time, nobody was making money off of the Internet, and we didn\u0027t patent any of the original ideas behind Archie,\" he explains. \"So the patents would have been where I would have made the money.\" Archie used the same techniques that every current search engine uses, so, Emtage adds, \"in that way, Archie was the great great grandfather of Google and all of those other search engines.\" Today, the Search industry earns $780 billion dollars annually. Emtage sees none of that money, but he is completely at ease with it. \"I don\u0027t feel like a father of anything,\" he states. \"It\u0027s not how I think of myself really ... Every now and again, I interact with somebody who\u0027s a real idiot, and I think to myself, \u0027Yeah, but you know what? I invented the search engine.\u0027\" Advertisement Go To Homepage Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Trending Follow us!",

For other uses, see Search engine (disambiguation). This article\u0027s tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia\u0027s categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing \"attention en masse\" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone\u0027s earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). This category combines all Wikipedia articles in need of updating from December 2023 (2023-12) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically.

Brave Search Screenshot of Brave Search Formerly Tailcat Type of site Web search engine Headquarters San Francisco, California, USA Created by Brave Software, Inc. URL search.brave.com Registration Optional[1] Launched June 2022; 3 years ago (June 2022) Current status Online Brave Search is a search engine developed by Brave Software, Inc., and is the default search engine for the Brave web browser in certain countries.[2] History [edit] Brave Search was developed following the acquisition of Tailcat, a privacy-focused search engine from Cliqz, a subsidiary of Hubert Burda Media based in Germany.[3][4][5][6] In October 2021, Brave Search was made the default search engine for Brave browser users in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom (replacing Google Search), France (replacing Qwant) and Germany (replacing DuckDuckGo).[7] In June 2022, Brave Search ended its beta stage and was fully released along with an announcement that within its year-long beta testing period, it surpassed 2.5 billion total queries.[6][8][9][10] Features [edit] Brave Search uses its own web index to generate search results with the aid of the WDP project.[11] However, the user can allow the Brave browser to anonymously check Google for the same query.[12] Discussions [edit] A feature that shows conversations related to the search query, such as comments on the website Reddit.[13] When a user searches and scrolls down, if available a discussions section will be there, and it will contain various forums where and the user can click one to see an answer from a user from an online community. Goggles [edit] A feature that allows users to apply their own rules and filters to a search.[14] Search API [edit] In May of 2023, Brave announced that it had launched a Search API.[15] Brave Search API is an interface that allows developers to integrate search functionalities from the Brave Search engine into their applications.[16] Answer with AI [edit] A large language model that automatically responds to some search queries, aided by content from web pages in the search results.[17] Brave Search Premium [edit] Users can optionally create an account with Brave Search Premium to support Brave Search directly involving data-collection.[1] As of January 2025, Brave Search is an ad-free website, but it will eventually switch to a new model that will include ads and premium users will get an ad-free experience.[1] Data collection [edit] User data including IP addresses won\u0027t be collected from its users by default.[18] However, Brave Search implements some level of data collect when users opt in through the Web Discovery Project (WDP).[19] No account is required for this function.[20] As of May 2022, it covered over 10 billion pages and was used to serve 92% of search results without relying on any third-parties, with the remainder being retrieved server-side from the Bing API or (on an opt-in basis) client-side from Google.[11] Limitations [edit] According to Brave, the index was kept \"intentionally smaller than that of Google or Bing\" in order to help avoid spam and other low-quality content, with the disadvantage that \"Brave Search is not yet as good as Google in recovering long-tail queries.\"[11] See also [edit] Internet portal Comparison of web search engines List of search engines List of search engines by popularity References [edit] ^ a b c Brave. \"What is Brave Search Premium?\".

    "title": "Proximity search (text) - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Computer text search query function In text processing, a proximity search looks for documents where two or more separately matching term occurrences are within a specified distance, where distance is the number of intermediate words or characters. In addition to proximity, some implementations may also impose a constraint on the word order, in that the order in the searched text must be identical to the order of the search query. Proximity searching goes beyond the simple matching of words by adding the constraint of proximity and is generally regarded as a form of advanced search. For example, a search could be used to find \"red brick house\", and match phrases such as \"red house of brick\" or \"house made of red brick\". By limiting the proximity, these phrases can be matched while avoiding documents where the words are scattered or spread across a page or in unrelated articles in an anthology. Rationale [edit] The basic linguistic assumption of proximity searching is that the proximity of the words in a document implies a relationship between the words. Given that authors of documents try to formulate sentences which contain a single idea, or cluster of related ideas within neighboring sentences or organized into paragraphs, there is an inherent, relatively high, probability within the document structure that words used together are related. On the other hand, when two words are on the opposite ends of a book, the probability of a relationship between the words is relatively weak. By limiting search results to only include matches where the words are within the specified maximum proximity, or distance, the search results are assumed to be of higher relevance than the matches where the words are scattered. Commercial internet search engines tend to produce too many matches (known as recall) for the average search query. Proximity searching is one method of reducing the number of pages matches, and to improve the relevance of the matched pages by using word proximity to assist in ranking. As an added benefit, proximity searching helps combat spamdexing by avoiding webpages which contain dictionary lists or shotgun lists of thousands of words, which would otherwise rank highly if the search engine was heavily biased toward word frequency. Boolean syntax and operators [edit] Note that a proximity search can designate that only some keywords must be within a specified distance. Proximity searching can be used with other search syntax and/or controls to allow more articulate search queries. Sometimes query operators like NEAR, NOT NEAR, FOLLOWED BY, NOT FOLLOWED BY, SENTENCE or FAR are used to indicate a proximity-search limit between specified keywords: for example, \"brick NEAR house\". Usage in commercial search engines [edit] In regards to implicit/automatic versus explicit proximity search, as of November 2008, most Internet search engines only implement an implicit proximity search functionality. That is, they automatically rank those search results higher where the user keywords have a good \"overall proximity score\" in such results. If only two keywords are in the search query, this has no difference from an explicit proximity search which puts a NEAR operator between the two keywords. However, if three or more than three keywords are present, it is often important for the user to specify which subsets of these keywords expect a proximity in search results. This is useful if the user wants to do a prior art search (e.g. finding an existing approach to complete a specific task, finding a document that discloses a system that exhibits a procedural behavior collaboratively conducted by several components and links between these components). Web search engines which support proximity search via an explicit proximity operator in their query language include Walhello, Exalead, Yandex, Yahoo!, Altavista, and Bing: When using the Walhello search-engine, the proximity can be defined by the number of characters between the keywords.[1] The search engine Exalead allows the user to specify the required proximity, as the maximum number of words between keywords. The syntax is (keyword1 NEAR/n keyword2) where n is the number of words.[2] Yandex uses the syntax keyword1 /n keyword2 to search for two keywords separated by at most n − 1 {\\displaystyle n-1} words, and supports a few other variations of this syntax.[3] Yahoo! and Altavista both support an undocumented NEAR operator.[4][5] The syntax is keyword1 NEAR keyword2. Google Search supports AROUND(#).[6][7] Bing supports NEAR.[8] The syntax is keyword1 near:n keyword2 where n\u003dthe number of maximum separating words. Ordered search within the Google and Yahoo! search engines is possible using the asterisk (*) full-word wildcards: in Google this matches one or more words,[9] and an in Yahoo! Search this matches exactly one word.[10] (This is easily verified by searching for the following phrase in both Google and Yahoo",

Share this item with your network: By Lev Craig Nicole Laskowski, Senior News Director Linda Tucci, Industry Editor -- CIO/IT Strategy Published: Oct 01, 2024 What is AI? Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Examples of AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, machine vision, and generative tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have scrambled to promote how their products and services incorporate it. Often, what they refer to as \"AI\" is a well-established technology such as machine learning. AI requires specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is used exclusively in AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia are all popular languages among AI developers. How does AI work? In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing that data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. This article is part of What is enterprise AI? A complete guide for businesses Which also includes: How can AI drive revenue? Here are 10 approaches 8 jobs that AI can\u0027t replace and why 10 AI and machine learning trends to watch in 2026 For example, an AI chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, and an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. Generative AI techniques, which have advanced rapidly over the past few years, can create realistic text, images, music and other media. Programming AI systems focuses on cognitive skills such as the following: Learning. This aspect of AI programming involves acquiring data and creating rules, known as algorithms, to transform it into actionable information. These algorithms provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks. Reasoning. This aspect involves choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome. Self-correction. This aspect involves algorithms continuously learning and tuning themselves to provide the most accurate results possible. Creativity. This aspect uses neural networks, rule-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, text, music, ideas and so on. Differences among AI, machine learning and deep learning The terms AI, machine learning and deep learning are often used interchangeably, especially in companies\u0027 marketing materials, but they have distinct meanings. In short, AI describes the broad concept of machines simulating human intelligence, while machine learning and deep learning are specific techniques within this field. The term AI, coined in the 1950s, encompasses an evolving and wide range of technologies that aim to simulate human intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning. Machine learning enables software to autonomously learn patterns and predict outcomes by using historical data as input. This approach became more effective with the availability of large training data sets. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, aims to mimic the brain\u0027s structure using layered neural networks. It underpins many major breakthroughs and recent advances in AI, including autonomous vehicles and ChatGPT. Why is AI important? AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks traditionally done by humans, including customer service, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control. In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. It is especially useful for repetitive, detail-oriented tasks such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are properly filled in.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Retired early Internet search engine created in 1993 W3 Catalog was an early web search engine, first released on September 2, 1993[1] by developer Oscar Nierstrasz at the University of Geneva. The engine was initially given the name jughead, but then later renamed.[2] Unlike later search engines, like Aliweb, which attempt to index the web by crawling over the accessible content of web sites, W3 Catalog exploited the fact that many high-quality, manually maintained lists of web resources were already available. W3 Catalog simply mirrored these pages, reformatted the contents into individual entries, and provided a Perl-based front-end to enable dynamic querying.[3][4] At the time, CGI did not yet exist, so W3 Catalog was implemented as an extension to Tony Sander\u0027s Plexus web server, implemented in Perl. W3 Catalog was retired on November 8, 1996.[3] In February 2010, the domain name w3catalog.com was acquired,[5] and like the original index, each new website entry was manually reviewed before being added.[6] The site was dormant again by 2023.

The company\u0027s headquarter is located in Paris, France,[3] and was a subsidiary of Dassault Systèmes.[4] Exalabs [edit] The CloudView product is also the platform for Exalead\u0027s public Web search engine, which was designed to apply semantic processing and faceted navigation to Web data volumes and usage.[5] Exalead also operates an online laboratory which uses the Web as a medium for developing applied technologies for business. Many of Exalabs projects are developed in conjunction with Exalead\u0027s partners in the Quaero[6][7] project. History [edit] Exalead was founded in 2000[3] by François Bourdoncle and Patrice Bertin (both of whom were involved in the development of the Alta Vista search engine), and began commercializing its products in 2005. On 8 June 2010, Dassault Systèmes acquired Exalead for 135 million Euros.[3][8] Exalead employed approximately 150 people in 2013. Since the acquisition, many startups have sprung from Exalead such as Dataiku founded by Florian Douetteau, former vice president and then CEO of Dataiku, a French analytics software editor.[9] Exalead has been integrated into NETVIBES, a Dassault Systèmes brand.[10] See also [edit] Internet portal List of search engines Search engine References [edit] ^ \"Butler Group Webinar on Search Based Applications\".

    "title": "Baidu Vs Google: The Twins Of Search Compared - FourWeekMBA",
    "content": "Skip to content By looking at Baidu – top Chinese website and search engine – and Google – US top website and search engine – the similarities are staggering both regarding how they work and how their business model is organized. Table of Contents Toggle Baidu in a nutshell As of 2017, Baidu made most of its revenues from advertising via its ads networks. The remaining part was mainly comprised of memberships from Baidu entertaining platform. Baid also has a few other segments of the business. In fact, besides online marketing services, Baidu offers cloud services, it has a segment dedicated to autonomous driving and a segment devoted to the market leading online entertainment service provider in China. Google in a nutshell Like Baidu, Google makes money primarily via its advertising networks (AdWords and AdSense) The remaining revenues come from Google Play, Google Cloud and Hardware. A small part is related to the Google bets, a set of risky ventures where Google is investing and where Google believes the future might lay ahead. Both make money from advertising As we’ve seen both Baidu and Google has a sophisticated business model that can align businesses that bid on keywords and content producers. Also, their search service is used by over a billion users. Google is many times over Baidu in terms of revenues. The search engine from Mountain View made over $95 billion in revenues in 2017, compared to Baidu over $11 billion in revenues from advertising. Both used a link-based algorithm to rank web pages Back in 1996, Robin Li built RankDex was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing. In 1998 RankDex was acquired by a Dow Jones subsidiary Tradeline.com. Even before Google’s Larry Page had built the algorithm that would make Google the most popular search engine on earth, PageRank. Many argue that Baidu is a clone of Google. Yet Robin Li has been innovating in the space of search before then Google’s founders. Both are betting on video content and self-driving cars In 2017 Baidu invested an additional $1.5 billion in iQIYI. Also, Baidu is investing in self-driving cars. Just like Google acquired YouTube and it believes self-driving cars represent the future. Is Baidu a clone of Google? At first sight, both in terms of business model and the way Baidu works it seems to be a clone of Google. However, by looking at the Baidu origin story and how it managed to conquer the Chinese market, Baidu had managed to become among the most recognized brands in China. Thus, Baidu is an innovative company for its own sake and not just a clone of Google. Handpicked related articles: How Does Twitter Make Money?

    "title": "Initial public offering - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Type of securities offering in which a private company becomes a public company \"IPO\" redirects here. For other uses, see IPO (disambiguation). An initial public offering (IPO) or stock launch is a public offering in which shares of a company are sold to institutional investors[1] and usually also to retail (individual) investors.[2] An IPO is typically underwritten by one or more investment banks, who also arrange for the shares to be listed on one or more stock exchanges. Through this process, colloquially known as floating, or going public, a privately held company is transformed into a public company. Initial public offerings can be used to raise new equity capital for companies, to monetize the investments of private shareholders such as company founders or private equity investors, and to enable easy trading of existing holdings or future capital raising by becoming publicly traded. After the IPO, shares are traded freely in the open market at what is known as the free float. Stock exchanges stipulate a minimum free float both in absolute terms (the total value as determined by the share price multiplied by the number of shares sold to the public) and as a proportion of the total share capital (i.e., the number of shares sold to the public divided by the total shares outstanding). Although IPO offers many benefits, there are also significant costs involved, chiefly those associated with the process such as banking and legal fees, and the ongoing requirement to disclose important and sometimes sensitive information. Details of the proposed offering are disclosed to potential purchasers in the form of a lengthy document known as a prospectus. Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter. Underwriters provide several services, including help with correctly assessing the value of shares (share price) and establishing a public market for shares (initial sale). Alternative methods such as the Dutch auction have also been explored and applied for several IPOs. History [edit] The earliest form of a company which issued public shares was the case of the publicani during the Roman Republic, although this claim is not shared by all modern scholars.[3] Like modern joint-stock companies, the publicani were legal bodies independent of their members whose ownership was divided into shares, or parts.[4] There is evidence that these shares were sold to public investors and traded in a type of over-the-counter market in the Forum, near the Temple of Castor and Pollux. The shares fluctuated in value, encouraging the activity of speculators, or quaestors. Mere evidence remains of the prices for which parts were sold, the nature of initial public offerings, or a description of stock market behavior. Publicani lost favor with the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire.[5] In the United States, the first IPO was the public offering of Bank of North America around 1783.[6] Advantages and disadvantages [edit] This section has multiple issues.

You can help. The talk page may contain suggestions. (May 2022) The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (May 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Advantages [edit] When a company becomes publicly listed, the money paid by the investing public for the newly issued shares goes directly to the company (primary offering) as well as to any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of the debt, or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares are traded in the market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares are traded in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not dilutive since no new shares are being created. Stock prices can change dramatically during a company\u0027s first days in the public mar",

It was created by Toby Heap of Heap Media Australia with the goal of saving energy by displaying a black background with grayish-white text color on search results.[2] As of July 2023, Blackle claims to have saved over 10.07 MWh of electrical energy.[3] Concept [edit] The concept behind Blackle is that computer monitors can use less energy by displaying darker colors. Blackle\u0027s design is based on a study that tested a variety of CRT and LCD monitors. However, the energy-saving claims, especially for users of LCD screens with a constant backlight, are disputed.[4][5][6] This concept was brought to the attention of Heap Media by a blog post, estimating that Google could save 750 megawatt hours a year by using it for CRT screens.[1][7] The homepage of Blackle provides a count of the number of watt hours claimed to have been saved by enabling this concept. History [edit] The Blackle Homepage (as of January 2021[update]) The Blackle Homepage (as of April 2007) Blackle launched in January 2007, gaining popularity and being featured in multiple mainstream media outlets during that time.[citation needed] Blackle International, which translated Blackle into Portuguese, French, Czech, Italian, and Dutch, was retired in 2019.

In this paper I examine the evolution of and competition in the internet search engine market. The goal of my analysis is to examine whether early entrants benefit in the long-run from their first-mover position in internet markets. I find that while early entrants (Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, and Altavista) still have an advantage, the pure \"brand effect\" advantage has been declining over time. Yahoo has maintained its leadership position by providing a superior product. The success of a wave of recent new entrants suggests that entry barriers are still quite low in the internet search engine market.

He is credited for being the person who invented the world\u0027s first search engine and guess what? He is a Barbadian! Just this week, it was announced that Emtage will be among ten Caribbean people who will receive honorary degrees from the University of the West Indies (UWI). Related Article Related article :Father of Internet Search Engine among 10 for UWI honorary degree Emtage conceived and implemented the first version of \u0027Archie\u0027 in 1989 – the world’s first internet search engine. The concept pioneered many of the techniques used by modern public search engines leading directly to today’s Google, Yahoo, and Bing. In 1992, together with Peter J. Deutsch, he founded Bunyip Information Systems Inc., the world’s first company dedicated to providing internet information services. Bunyip went on to distribute a licensed commercial version of the Archie search engine. Back in 2013, in an exclusive interview with Huff Post, Emtage explained he \"wrote a piece of code that gave birth to a multibillion-dollar industry\". He said, although he did not make any money from the ground-breaking venture, he would not \"change anything\" about the whole experience. Here are a few extra must-know-tid-bits about the man born of Barbadian soil: - He is the son of Sir Stephen and Lady Emtage. - He attended Harrison College from 1975 to 1983 and was a Barbados scholar. - He is the first person from Barbados and the Caribbean to be inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. - He studied at the McGill University in Canada where he received a Bachelor\u0027s and Master\u0027s Degree in Computer Science. - He said he has no regrets about choosing not to patent the invention and admits he is \"quite happy not to be a billionaire\".

Founded by Marc Smith, Mojeek has grown steadily as a private and independent alternative to mainstream search engines.[6][7][8] History [edit] In 2004, the Mojeek search engine started out as a personal project by Marc Smith at the Sussex Innovation Centre. The search technology was created from the ground up using mostly the C programming language and for much of its early life, the servers were run from Smith\u0027s bedroom.[9] In 2006, Mojeek became the first search engine to have a no tracking privacy policy. This policy remains in place to this day.[10][11] After receiving investment, Mojeek was officially incorporated as a limited company in 2009.[12] On 26 January 2011, it was highlighted as an alternative British-based search engine during a Parliamentary debate on UK internet search engines over \"allegations of manipulation of Google\u0027s search results, particularly the unfavourable treatment of its unpaid and sponsored results, and the preferential placement of [their] own services.\"[13] As of 2013, Mojeek\u0027s servers are run from the Custodian data centres in Maidstone, which bills itself as \"one of the greenest data centres in the UK.\"[14][15] On 15 April 2015, the BBC\u0027s World Global Show and Radio 5 Live talked to Smith about the Mojeek search engine and the EU\u0027s decision to file a complaint against Google over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.[16] In 2017, in partnership with EMRAYS Technologies, Mojeek launched a demo of their emotional search engine which allows users to search for pages with certain emotional content.[17] As of May 2019, Mojeek\u0027s index contained over 2.3 billion pages,[18] and by April 2020, that number had increased to over 3 billion.[19] As of June 2021 Mojeek has 4 billion pages [20] and in March 2022, 5 billion pages.[21] It hit the 6 billion mark in October 2022.[22][23] In 2022, Mojeek became the default search engine of Privacy Browser.[24] It was subsequently added to Pale Moon[25] and the SerenityOS web browser.[26] Starting mid-2023,[27] Kagi Search lists Mojeek as one of the sources for its results.[28] Key features [edit] Mojeek is a crawler-based search engine that provides independent[29] search results using its own index of web pages, rather than using results from other search engines. Mojeek also displays significantly more individual entries in its search results than Google or Bing.[30] Etymology [edit] On 23 October 2022, Mojeek confirmed on Twitter that there is no real meaning or genuine etymology behind the word \"mojeek\" and that the word was simply made up.[31] See also [edit] Internet portal Comparison of web search engines List of search engines List of search engines by popularity References [edit] ^ \"Sussex Innovation Centre | UKSPA\". www.ukspa.org.uk.

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Video search engine\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (May 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A video search engine is a web-based search engine which crawls the web for video content. Some video search engines parse externally hosted content while others allow content to be uploaded and hosted on their own servers. Some engines also allow users to search by video format type and by length of the clip. The video search results are usually accompanied by a thumbnail view of the video. Video search engines are computer programs designed to find videos stored on digital devices, either through Internet servers or in storage units from the same computer. These searches can be made through audiovisual indexing, which can extract information from audiovisual material and record it as metadata, which will be tracked by search engines. Utility [edit] The main use of these search engines is the increasing creation of audiovisual content and the need to manage it properly. The digitization of audiovisual archives and the establishment of the Internet, has led to large quantities of video files stored in big databases, whose recovery can be very difficult because of the huge volumes of data and the existence of a semantic gap. Search criterion [edit] The search criterion used by each search engine depends on its nature and purpose of the searches. Metadata [edit] Metadata is information about facts. It could be information about who is the author of the video, creation date, duration, and all the information that could be extracted and included in the same files. Internet is often used in a language called XML to encode metadata, which works very well through the web and is readable by people. Thus, through this information contained in these files is the easiest way to find data of interest to us. In the videos there are two types of metadata, that we can integrate in the video code itself and external metadata from the page where the video is. In both cases we optimize them to make them ideal when indexed. Internal metadata [edit] All video formats incorporate their own metadata. The title, description, coding quality or transcription of the content are possible. To review these data exist programs like FLV MetaData Injector, Sorenson Squeeze or Castfire. Each one has some utilities and special specifications. Converting from one format to another can lose much of this data, so check that the new format information is correct. It is therefore advisable to have the video in multiple formats, so all search robots will be able to find and index it. External metadata [edit] In most cases the same mechanisms must be applied as in the positioning of an image or text content. Title and description [edit] They are the most important factors when positioning a video, because they contain most of the necessary information. The titles have to be clearly descriptive and should remove every word or phrase that is not useful. Filename [edit] It should be descriptive, including keywords that describe the video with no need to see their title or description. Ideally, separate the words by dashes \"-\". Tags [edit] On the page where the video is, it should be a list of keywords linked to the microformat \"rel-tag\". These words will be used by search engines as a basis for organizing information. Transcription and subtitles [edit] Although not completely standard, there are two formats that store information in a temporal component that is specified, one for subtitles and another for transcripts, which can also be used for subtitles. The formats are SRT or SUB for subtitles and TTXT for transcripts. Speech recognition [edit] Speech recognition consists of a transcript of the speech of the audio track of the videos, creating a text file. In this way and with the help of a phrase extractor can easily search if the video content is of interest. Some search engines apart from using speech recognition to search for videos, also use it to find the specific point of a multimedia file in which a specific word or phrase is located and so go directly to this point. Gaudi (Google Audio Indexing), a project developed by Google Labs, uses voice recognition technology to locate the exact moment that one or more words have been spoken within an audio, allowing the user to go directly to exact moment that the words were spoken. If the search query matches some videos from YouTube, the positions are indicated by yellow markers, and must pass the mouse over to read the transcribed text. Speaker recognition [edit] In addition to transcription, analysis can detect different speakers and sometime attribute the speech to an identified name for the s",

Rabin, Michael Ben-Or Judit Bar-Ilan (Hebrew: יהודית בר-אילן, 1958–2019) was an Israeli computer scientist known for her research in informetrics and scientometrics. She was a professor of information science, and head of the Department of Information Science at Bar-Ilan University.[1] Education and career [edit] Bar-Ilan was born in 1958.[2] She was a student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she earned a bachelor\u0027s degree in 1981, an education diploma in 1982, a master\u0027s degree in 1983 and a Ph.D. in 1990.[3] Her dissertation, Applications of One-Way Functions and Randomization in Security Protocols, was jointly supervised by Michael O. Rabin and Michael Ben-Or.[4] After working for a year as a visiting lecturer at the University of Haifa, Bar-Ilan returned to the Hebrew University as an external teacher and later teaching fellow and teacher in library, archive and information studies. She joined the Bar-Ilan University Department of Information Science in 2002, where she was head of department from 2008 to 2012 and was promoted to full professor in 2010.[3] Contributions [edit] Bar-Ilan did important work early in her career in the fault tolerance of distributed computing,[1] and her dissertation research was in cryptography.[4] However, she is best known for her research on informetrics, scientometrics, information retrieval, and web search engines. Her interest in these topics stemmed from her work in the early 1990s on applications of distributed computing in library science. This work led her to perform important studies in the late 1990s on the accuracy, reliability, and stability over time of search engine results, and on the ability of search engines to handle non-English queries. She also used search engine results to study the link structure of the web, and applied methodologies including content analysis, user surveys, and user studies in these areas. Later in her career, her interests shifted to scientometrics, including citation analysis and studies of the h-index as well as altmetrics for measuring scholarly productivity. She also investigated the patterns of politically motivated internet activity.[1] Recognition [edit] The International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics gave Bar-Ilan their Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal in 2017, \"for her distinguished contribution to the field of scientometrics\".[2][5] The Association for Information Science and Technology gave her their Research in Information Science Award in 2018, for \"sustained contributions to informetrics, bibliometrics information retrieval, and most recently altmetrics, domains at the core of information science\".[2][6] A special memorial issue dedicated to Judit Bar-Ilan was published in the journal Scientometrics in June 2020.[7] Personal life [edit] Bar-Ilan died on July 16, 2019.[2] References [edit] ^ a b c Thelwall, Mike (October 2017), \"Judit Bar-Ilan: information scientist, computer scientist, scientometrician\", Scientometrics, 113 (3): 1235–1244, doi:10.1007/s11192-017-2551-3, S2CID 32600803 ^ a b c d Death of Professor Judit Bar-Ilan, iSchools, July 17, 2019 ^ a b Prof. Bar-Ilan Judit, Bar-Ilan University, retrieved 2019-07-17 ^ a b Judit Bar-Ilan at the Mathematics Genealogy Project ^ \"Judit Bar-Ilan wins the 2017 Derek John de Solla Price Medal\", Scientometrics, 113 (3): 1233–1234, October 2017, doi:10.1007/s11192-017-2552-2, S2CID 12179027 ^ Middleton, Lydia (August 8, 2018), Bar-Ilan Wins Research Award, Association for Information Science and Technology ^ \"Special Issue: Judit Bar-Ilan Memorial Issue\", Scientometrics, 123 (3), June 2020 External links [edit] Judit Bar-Ilan publications indexed by Google Scholar Authority control databases International ISNI VIAF WorldCat National United States Israel Academics ORCID Mathematics Genealogy Project ResearcherID Scopus zbMATH Google Scholar DBLP Publons Retrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title\u003dJudit_Bar-Ilan\u0026oldid\u003d1288190042\" Categories: 1958 births 2019 deaths Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Academic staff of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Academic staff of Bar-Ilan University Israeli women computer scientists Israeli computer scientists Burials at Har HaMenuchot Hidden categories: Articles with short description Short description is different from Wikidata Pages where birth or death is being automatically determined Articles with hCards Pages using infobox person with deprecated parameters Ar",

The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Jackson Arthur E. Kennelly[1] Notable students Claude Shannon Frederick Terman Charles Manneback Perry O. Crawford Jr. Samuel H. Caldwell Vannevar Bush (/væˈniːvɑːr/ van-NEE-var; March 11, 1890 – June 28, 1974) was an American engineer, inventor and science administrator, who during World War II headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), through which almost all wartime military R\u0026D was carried out, including important developments in radar and the initiation and early administration of the Manhattan Project. He emphasized the importance of scientific research to national security and economic well-being, and was chiefly responsible for the movement that led to the creation of the National Science Foundation. Bush joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1919, and founded the company that became Raytheon in 1922. Bush became vice president of MIT and dean of the MIT School of Engineering in 1932, and president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1938. During his career, Bush patented a string of his own inventions. He is known particularly for his engineering work on analog computers, and for the memex. Starting in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, a mechanical analog computer with some digital components that could solve differential equations with as many as 18 independent variables. An offshoot of the work at MIT by Bush and others was the beginning of digital circuit design theory. The memex, which he began developing in the 1930s (heavily influenced by Emanuel Goldberg\u0027s \"Statistical Machine\" from 1928) was a hypothetical adjustable microfilm viewer with a structure analogous to that of hypertext. The memex and Bush\u0027s 1945 essay \"As We May Think\" influenced generations of computer scientists, who drew inspiration from his vision of the future. Bush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the president of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation. Early life and education [edit] Vannevar Bush was born in Everett, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1890.[2] He was the third child and only son of Richard Perry Bush, the local Universalist pastor, and his wife Emma Linwood (née Paine), the daughter of a prominent Provincetown family.[3] He had two older sisters, Edith and Reba. He was named after John Vannevar, an old friend of the family who had attended Tufts College with Perry. The family moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, in 1892,[4] and Bush graduated from Chelsea High School in 1909.[5] B",

The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold.

Yandex Search is the largest search engine in Russia with an estimated 72% market share in Russia[6] and a 2.8% market share worldwide.[7] Yandex Taxi is the largest ridesharing company in Russia.[8] Yandex was founded by Arkady Volozh and launched its first product, a search engine, in 1997. Due to its significant media activities in Russia, the company has long faced pressure for control by the government of Russia. In July 2024, in a transaction brought about by international sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and restrictions on foreign ownership, Nebius Group, the Dutch holding company that owned Yandex, sold its Russian assets to a group of Russian investors for a discounted price of US$5.3 billion. History [edit] 1990s [edit] In 1990, Arkady Volozh contacted Ilya Segalovich (1964–2013), a friend of his from high school, to join his venture developing algorithms to search Russian texts.[9] They developed search software together under the company name Arcadia.[10] In 1993, they invented the name \"Yandex\" as an easy way to remember \"Yet Another iNDEXer\".[11] This is also a bilingual pun on \"index\" since \"Я\" (\"ya\") means \"I\" in Russian. On September 23, 1997, the Yandex.ru search engine was launched and presented at the Softool exhibition in Moscow.[12] In 1998, Yandex launched contextual advertisement on its search engine.[13] In 2000, Yandex was incorporated in Cyprus as a standalone company.[14] 2000s [edit] Arcadia became part of CompTek, a software and computer parts supply company, with Volozh as the CEO in 2000.[15] In 2000, Baring Vostok Capital Partners acquired 35.72% of the company for $5.28 million.[16] In 2001, Yandex launched the Yandex.Direct online advertising network.[17] The company became profitable in 2003.[18] Between 2004 and 2006, Tiger Technologies obtained an 11% ownership stake in the company.[19] In September 2005, Yandex opened an office in Ukraine and launched a Ukrainian website.[20] In 2007, Yandex introduced a customized search engine for Ukrainian users, and in May 2007, it opened a development center in Kyiv. In 2008, Yandex increased bandwidth between its Moscow data centers and UA-IX in Ukraine fivefold. In 2009, all services of www.yandex.ua were localized for the Ukrainian market. In 2010, Yandex launched its \"Poltava\" search engine algorithm for Ukrainian users based on its MatrixNet technology. In March 2007, Yandex acquired moikrug.ru, a Russian social networking service.[21] Logo used from 2008 to 2016 In June 2008, Yandex announced the formation of Yandex Labs in Silicon Valley to foster innovation in search and advertising technology, with Vishal Makhijani as its CEO.[22][23] Also in June 2008, Yandex acquired SMILink, a Russian road traffic monitoring agency, which was merged into Yandex Maps.[24] In September 2008, the company acquired the rights to the Punto Switcher software program, an automatic Russian-to-English keyboard layout switcher.[25] In January 2009, Firefox 3.5 replaced Google with Yandex as the default search provider for Russian-language builds.[26] Google was reinstated in 2012.[27] 2010s [edit] In May 2010, Yandex launched an English language-only search engine.[28][29][30] In September 2010, Yandex launched Yandex Music, a music streaming service, with a catalogue of 800,000 tracks from 58,000 performers.[31][32][33] Also in September 2010, Yandex invested in a $4.3 million financing round by Face.com (formerly Vizi Labs).[34] The company was acquired by Facebook in 2012 and Yandex receiv",

The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images.

This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so.

(Larry, 22, a U Michigan grad, is considering the school; Sergey, 21, is assigned to show him around.) According to some accounts, they disagree about almost everything during this first meeting. 1996 Larry and Sergey, now Stanford computer science grad students, begin collaborating on a search engine called BackRub. BackRub operates on Stanford servers for more than a year—eventually taking up too much bandwidth to suit the university. 1997 Larry and Sergey decide that the BackRub search engine needs a new name. After some brainstorming, they go with Google—a play on the word “googol,” a mathematical term for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. The use of the term reflects their mission to organize a seemingly infinite amount of information on the web. Back to top 1998 August Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim writes a check for $100,000 to an entity that doesn’t exist yet: a company called Google Inc. September Google sets up workspace in Susan Wojcicki’s garage at 232 Santa Margarita, Menlo Park. Google files for incorporation in California on September 4. Shortly thereafter, Larry and Sergey open a bank account in the newly-established company’s name and deposit Andy Bechtolsheim’s check. Larry and Sergey hire Craig Silverstein as their first employee; he’s a fellow computer science grad student at Stanford. December “PC Magazine” reports that Google “has an uncanny knack for returning extremely relevant results” and recognizes us as the search engine of choice in the Top 100 Web Sites for 1998. Back to top 1999 February We outgrow our garage office and move to new digs at 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto with just eight employees. April Yoshka, our first “company” dog, comes to work with our senior vice president of operations, Urs Hoelzle. May Omid Kordestani joins to run sales—the first non-engineering hire. June Our first press release announces a $25 million round from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins; John Doerr and Michael Moritz join the board. The release quotes Moritz describing “Googlers” as ”people who use Google”. August We move to our first Mountain View location: 2400 E. Bayshore. Mountain View is a few miles south of Stanford University, and north of the older towns of Silicon Valley: Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San Jose. November Charlie Ayers joins as Google’s first chef. He wins the job in a cook-off judged by the company’s 40 employees. Previous claim to fame: catering for the Grateful Dead. Back to top 2000 April On April Fools’ Day, we announce the MentalPlex: Google’s ability to read your mind as you visualize the search results you want. Thus begins our annual foray in the Silicon Valley tradition of April 1 hoaxes. May The first 10 language versions of Google.com are released: French, German, Italian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Norwegian and Danish. We win our first Webby Awards: Technical Achievement (voted by judges) and Peoples’ Voice (voted by users). June We forge a partnership with Yahoo! to become their default search provider. We announce the first billion-URL index and therefore Google becomes the world’s largest search engine. September We start offering search in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, bringing our total number of supported languages to 15. October Google AdWords launches with 350 customers. The self-service ad program promises online activation with a credit card, keyword targeting and performance feedback. December Google Toolbar is released. It’s a browser plug-in that makes it possible to search without visiting the Google homepage.

It is now divided between Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.[1] Although the terms \"Indian subcontinent\" and \"South Asia\" are often also used interchangeably to denote a wider region which includes, in addition, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the \"Indian subcontinent\" is more of a geophysical term, whereas \"South Asia\" is more geopolitical.[2] \"South Asia\" frequently also includes Afghanistan, which is not considered part of the subcontinent even in extended usage.[3] Name Historically, the region surrounding and southeast of the Indus River was often simply referred to as India in many historical sources. Even today, historians use this term to denote the entire Indian subcontinent when discussing history up until the era of the British Raj. Over time, however, \"India\" evolved to refer to a distinct political entity that eventually became a nation-state (today the Republic of India).[4] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term subcontinent signifies a \"subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity\" and also a \"large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent\".[5][6] Its use to signify the Indian subcontinent is evidenced from the early twentieth century when most of the territory was either part of the British Empire or allied with them.[7][8] It was a convenient term to refer to the region comprising both British India and the princely states.[9][10] The term has been particularly common in the British Empire and its successors,[11] while the term South Asia is the more common usage in Europe and North America as well as in most countries in South Asia itself sometimes.[12][13] According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia \"in more recent and neutral parlance\".[14] Indologist Ronald B. Inden argues that the usage of the term South Asia is becoming more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia.[15] While South Asia, a more accurate term that reflects the region\u0027s contemporary political demarcations, is replacing the Indian subcontinent, a term closely linked to the region\u0027s colonial heritage, as a cover term, the latter is still widely used in typological studies.[16][17] Since the Partition of India, citizens of Pakistan (which became independent of British India in 1947) and Bangladesh (which became independent of Pakistan in 1971) often perceive the use of the Indian subcontinent as offensive and suspicious because of the dominant placement of India in the term.[18] As such it is being increasingly less used in those countries.[note 7] Meanwhile, many Indian analysts prefer to use the term because of the socio-cultural commonalities of the region.[18] The region has also been called the \"Asian subcontinent\",[20][21] the \"South Asian subcontinent\",[22][23][24][25] as well as \"India\" or \"Greater India\" in the classical and pre-modern sense.[26][3][27][28] The sport of cricket, introduced to the region by the British, is notably popular in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Within a cricket context, these countries are sometimes referred to simply as the subcontinent e.g. \"Australia\u0027s tour of the subcontinent\".[29] The term is also sometimes used adjectivally in cricket e.g. \"subcontinental conditions\".[30][31] Geology See also: Indian plate and Himalayas § Geology Cimmeria, having rifted from Gondwana shown drifting towards Eurasia, closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean above, openi",

As a multidisciplinary publication, Nature features peer-reviewed research from a variety of academic disciplines, mainly in science and technology. It has core editorial offices across the United States, continental Europe, and Asia under the international scientific publishing company Springer Nature. Nature was one of the world\u0027s most cited scientific journals by the Science Edition of the 2022 Journal Citation Reports (with an ascribed impact factor of 50.5),[1] making it one of the world\u0027s most-read and most prestigious academic journals.[2][3][4] As of 2012[update], it claimed an online readership of about three million unique readers per month.[5] Founded in the autumn of 1869, Nature was first circulated by Norman Lockyer and Alexander MacMillan as a public forum for scientific innovations. The mid-20th century facilitated an editorial expansion for the journal; Nature redoubled its efforts in explanatory and scientific journalism. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the creation of a network of editorial offices outside of Britain and the establishment of ten new supplementary, speciality publications (e.g. Nature Materials). Since the late 2000s, dedicated editorial and current affairs columns are created weekly, and electoral endorsements are featured. The primary source of the journal remains, as established at its founding, research scientists; editing standards are primarily concerned with technical readability. Each issue also features articles that are of general interest to the scientific community, namely business, funding, scientific ethics, and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. The main research published in Nature consists mostly of papers (articles or letters) in lightly edited form. They are highly technical and dense, but, due to imposed text limits, they are typically summaries of larger work. Innovations or breakthroughs in any scientific or technological field are featured in the journal as either letters or news articles. The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Conversely, due to the journal\u0027s exposure, it has at various times been a subject of controversy for its handling of academic dishonesty, the scientific method, and news coverage. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.[6] In 2007, Nature (together with Science) received the Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity.[7][8] Nature mostly publishes research articles. Spotlight articles are not research papers but mostly news or magazine style papers and hence do not count towards impact factor nor receive similar recognition as research articles. Some spotlight articles are also paid by partners or sponsors.[9] History [edit] Background [edit] The huge progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.[10] The most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the Royal Society, which had published many of the great works from Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday to Charles Darwin. In addition, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.[11] According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as \"organs of science\", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.[11] Nature, first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede Nature was Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation,[12] which, created in 1859,",

(2017–present) Website isp.netscape.com Netscape Communications Corporation (originally Mosaic Communications Corporation) was an American independent computer services company with headquarters in Mountain View, California, and then Dulles, Virginia.[2] Its Netscape web browser was once dominant but lost to Internet Explorer and other competitors in the first browser war, with its market share falling from more than 90 percent in the mid-1990s[3] to less than one percent in 2006.[4] An early Netscape employee, Brendan Eich, created the JavaScript programming language, the most widely used language for client-side scripting of web pages. A founding engineer of Netscape, Lou Montulli, created HTTP cookies. The company also developed SSL which was used for securing online communications and was later renamed to TLS.[5] Netscape stock traded from 1995 until 1999 when the company was acquired by AOL in a pooling-of-interests transaction ultimately worth US$10 billion.[6][7] In February 1998, approximately one year before its acquisition by AOL, Netscape released the source code for its browser and created the Mozilla Organization to coordinate future development of its product.[8] The Mozilla Organization rewrote the entire browser\u0027s source code based on the Gecko rendering engine,[9] and all future Netscape releases were based on this rewritten code. When AOL scaled back its involvement with Mozilla Organization in the early 2000s, the Organization proceeded to establish the Mozilla Foundation in July 2003 to ensure its continued independence with financial and other assistance from AOL.[10] The Gecko engine is used to power the Mozilla Foundation\u0027s Firefox browser. In addition to browsers, Netscape developed a suite of award-winning server software, known as SuiteSpot, to power enterprise Internet and Intranet websites, forums, and email; e-commerce software; and a consumer web portal named Netcenter. Netscape\u0027s browser development continued until December 2007, when AOL announced that the company would stop supporting it by early 2008.[11][12] As of 2024, AOL continues to use the Netscape brand to market a discount Internet service provider, which itself continues to provide a Chromium-based web browser called Netscape, developed by UK security firm SentryBay.[13][14][15][16][better source needed] History [edit] Early years [edit] Netscape Communications wants you to forget all the highway metaphors you\u0027ve ever heard about the Internet. Instead, think about an encyclopedia—one with unlimited, graphically rich pages, connections to Email and files, and access to Internet newsgroups and online shopping. —Netscape Navigator, Macworld (May 1995)[17] Mosaic was developed at the tax payer funded National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign beginning in late 1992. Mosaic became a private venture as Mosaic Communications Corporation on April 4, 1994, the brainchild of Jim Clark who had recruited Marc Andreessen as co-founder and Kleiner Perkins as investors. The first meeting between Clark and Andreessen was never truly about a software or service like Netscape, but more about a product that was similar to Nintendo.[18] Clark recruited other early team members from SGI and NCSA Mosaic. Jim Barksdale came on board as CEO in January 1995.[19] Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen created a 20-page concept pitch for an online gaming network to Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 console, but a deal was never reached. Marc Andreessen explains, \"If they had shipped a year earlier, we probably would have done that instead of Netscape.\"[20] The company\u0027s first product was the web browser, called Mosaic Netscape 0.9, released on October 13, 1994. Within four months of its release, it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market.[18] It became the main browser for Internet users in such a short time due to its superiority over other competition, like Mosaic.[18] This browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator, and the company took the \"Netscape\" name (coined by employee Greg Sands,[19] although it was also a trademark of Cisco Systems[21]) on November 14, 1994,[22] to avoid trademark ownership problems with NCSA, where the initial Netscape employees had previously created the NCSA Mosaic w",

It provides search, machine learning and chatbot technologies[3] as well as pay-per-click and contextual advertising services. LookSmart also licenses and manages search ad networks as white-label products. It abides by the click measurement guidelines of the Interactive Advertising Bureau.[4] LookSmart also owns several subsidiaries, including Clickable Inc., LookSmart AdCenter, Novatech.io, ShopWiki[5] and Syncapse.[6] The current CEO of LookSmart is Michael Onghai[7] and the company is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.[8] Etymology [edit] The name \"LookSmart\" is a double entendre, referring to both its selective, editorially compiled directory and as a compliment to users whom the company thinks \"look smart\".[9] History [edit] 1995–1998 [edit] LookSmart was founded as Homebase in 1995 in Melbourne, Australia by husband and wife Evan Thornley and Tracy Ellery, executives of McKinsey \u0026 Company.[2] Reader\u0027s Digest invested $5 million in the company for an 80% stake.[2] The original concept of Homebase was to build a female and family-friendly web portal to supplement the Reader\u0027s Digest magazine.[2] After leadership and strategy changes at Reader\u0027s Digest, which reduced RD\u0027s focus on its online business, RD wanted to shut down Homebase, which would have cost $4 million in payouts and other termination costs.[2] The founders and former McKinsey\u0027s employee Martin Hosking instead proposed a cheaper leveraged buyout of Homebase.[2] On 28 October 1996, the company launched its LookSmart search engine.[10] At launch, the search engine listed more than 85,000 sites and had a \"Java-enhanced\" interface.[10] In June 1997, the search engine underwent a major redesign, dropping its original Java-based browsing system.[11] LookSmart was sold back to the founders as well as Martin Hosking through a leveraged buyout in 1998, with Reader\u0027s Digest providing a $1.5 million loan and retaining about a 10% equity stake.[2][12] Also in 1998, a search box was added to the LookSmart search engine along with People Search, Yellow pages, Discussions and shopping search.[13] In May 1998, the company raised $2.3 million from Amwin and $6.0 million from Cox Media Group and Macquarie Bank and was valued at $23.3 million.[2] On 21 December 1998, LookSmart stopped accepting pornographic advertisements.[14] 1999–2001 [edit] By 1999, the company had 500 employees and LookSmart was the twelfth most visited website worldwide with 10 million users, behind AltaVista and ahead of Snap.[2] In early-1999, the company reached an agreement to provide directory and listing services for Microsoft for 5 years. The deal provided the company with $30 million upfront and guaranteed payments of $5 million per year.[2][15] In late-March 1999, the company raised $59.6 million based on a post-money valuation of $430 million from Amerindo Investment Advisors, Citicorp Equity Capital, Cox Interactive Media, Hambrecht \u0026 Quist and others.[2][16] In May 1999, LookSmart formed a strategic partnership with direct-response marketing company Guthy-Renker and acquired some of their assets from their e-commerce division for $3 million.[17][18] On 20 August 1999, during the dot-com bubble, the company became a public company via an initial public offering on the NASDAQ, debuting at $12 per share and raising $92.4 million based on a $1 billion valuation for the company.[2][19] LookSmart used the money it made from its IPO to open offices in Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.[20] By October 1999, the stock price reached $30 per share, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.5 billion.[20] The founders\u0027 15% stake was worth $375 million.[21] On 10 November 1999, LookSmart and BT Group founded joint venture BT LookSmart.[22][23] In December 1999, LookSmart purchased FutureCorp and its free email service Start for more than $5 million from its co-founders Michael Mak and Bardia Housman.[24] Also in December, LookSmart acquired 14.5% of the voting stock of Dstore Pty Ltd. for $300,000.[25] In 2000, FindArticles, a website which provided access to articles previously published in magazines, journals, and other sources, was founded[26][27][28] as a partnership between LookSmart, which authored the search technology, and the Gale Group, which provided the articles for a fee.[29][30][31] In March 2000, LookSmart\u0027s stock price briefly peaked at $72 per share.[12][32] On 28 March 2000, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) signed a sponsorship deal with LookSmart by adding a custom-built LookSmart directory to the Olympic Games\u0027 website.[33] On 30 May 2000, Juno Online Services reached an agree",

For other uses, see Search engine (disambiguation). This article\u0027s tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

(June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

It is operated by the namesake company Yahoo! Inc., which is 90% owned by Apollo Global Management and 10% by Verizon. Yahoo was established by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.[6] However, its use declined in the 2010s as some of its services were discontinued, and it lost market share to Facebook and Google.[7][8] Etymology The word \"yahoo\" is a backronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\"[9] or \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\".[10] The term \"hierarchical\" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term \"oracle\" was intended to mean \"source of truth and wisdom\", and the term \"officious\", rather than being related to the word\u0027s normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[11] However, founders Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a \"yahoo\" (used by college students in David Filo\u0027s native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.\"[12] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver\u0027s Travels. History Main articles: History of Yahoo and Yahoo! Inc. (1995–2017) Founding Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo The Yahoo home page in 1994, when it was a directory. A search engine was added in 1995. In January 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named \"Jerry and David\u0027s guide to the World Wide Web\".[13][14][15][16] The site was a human-edited web directory, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, \"Jerry and David\u0027s Guide to the World Wide Web\" was renamed \"Yahoo!\" and became known as the Yahoo Directory.[14][17][18][19][20] The \"yahoo.com\" domain was registered on January 18, 1995.[21] Yahoo was incorporated on March 2, 1995. In 1995, a search engine function, called Yahoo Search, was introduced. This allowed users to search Yahoo Directory.[22][23] Yahoo soon became the first popular online directory and search engine on the World Wide Web.[24] Expansion Map showing localized versions of Yahoo web portals, as of 2023 Yahoo sign at Times Square, 2010 Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Yahoo became a public company via an initial public offering in April 1996 and its stock price rose 600% within two years.[25] Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal, putting it in competition with services including Excite, Lycos, and America Online.[26] By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users,[27] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine,[19] receiving 95 million page views per day, triple that of rival Excite.[25] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Yahoo began offering free e-mail from October 1997 after the acquisition of RocketMail, which was then renamed to Yahoo Mail.[28] In 1998, Yahoo replaced AltaVista as the crawler-based search engine underlying the Directory with Inktomi.[29] Yahoo\u0027s two biggest acquisitions were made in 1999: GeoCities for $3.6 billion[30] and Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion.[31] Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, closing at an all-time high of $118.75/share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.[32] Missed acquisitions of Google Yahoo had two critical opportunities to acquire Google that it did not pursue. In 1998, Google\u0027s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin approached Yahoo to sell their nascent search engine for $1 million,",

    "content": "Replacement of Google with Alternative Search Systems in China Documentation and Screen Shots Berkman Center for Internet \u0026 Society Harvard Law School Overview The authors are studying Internet filtering in countries worldwide, and current investigations focus on restrictions on web access in China. Using a web-based system to test web filtering in China, the authors previously determined and confirmed that Google was inaccessible from at least one testing location in China; initially, in testing beginning August 29, a request for Google led to the error \"host not found,\" consistent with requests for other inaccessible or blocked sites. However, using related methods, the authors have now confirmed and documented reports that Chinese Internet access currently provides pages other than the ordinary Google home page in response to requests for google.com; such behavior is believed to have begun on September 8. The screen shots below document 6 instances of this replacement. Update (11:00 PM EST on September 11): Sources in China and the Real-Time Testing System confirm that Google is now reachable in China as usual. Requests for www.google.com now yield the expected Google search page (and not the third-party sites preserved below). However, searches for certain controversial sites appear to be restricted. The authors are working to prepare a sample of specific prohibited terms as well as to document the method of filtering. Current testing suggests that filtering may vary across China. Some parts of China may not filter Google keywords at all, while other parts may disconnect a user\u0027s Internet connection (even an \"always-on\" high-speed connection) in response to a search for a prohibited term. Prohibited terms seem to include \"jiang zemin\" and \"cache\"; the latter is typically associated with requests to use Google\u0027s system for viewing archived content from other web sites. Methodology The authors connected to the Chinese network so as to simulate network access just as experienced by ordinary users located in Beijing, China. The authors prepared the screen shots shown below on the morning of September 10, 2002, and each request reflects an ordinary web browser displaying the requested URL http://www.google.com. (Note that all screen shots but the second still show that URL; the site shown in the second screen shot seems to use a redirect to change the location specified in the browser\u0027s Address Bar.) Screen Shots The screen shots shown below reflect that recent Chinese requests for www.google.com have instead been replaced with other sites including Openfind, Globepage, chinaren.com, search.online.sh.cn, fm365.com, and a search system at Peking University.

See also the authors\u0027 Other Resources about Internet Filtering in China. Martin Schwimmer has analyzed certain legal implications (namely, implications under trademark law) of China\u0027s apparent replacement of Google with other sites. The authors have manually tested access to a number of other sites previously found to be inaccessible over time (and therefore thought to be blocked intentionally by Chinese network administrators). Of these many sites, only Google was found to forward requests to third-party hosts (as detailed above); no other site was found to do so. The authors request and would much value information about any other blocked sites treated similarly to Google; such information would improve the accuracy of the system for Real-Time Testing of Internet Filtering in China and would likely be of substantial further interest. The authors thank Yuen Chan, Thomas Crampton of the International Herald Tribune, and others who brought this issue to their attention.

    "content": "Knowbot programming: System support for mobile agents Jeremy Hylton, Ken Manheimer, Fred L. Drake Jr., Barry Warsaw, Roger Masse, Guido van Rossum Corporation for National Research Initiatives 1895 Preston White Dr., Reston, VA 22091 knowboteers@cnri.reston.va.us Abstract Knowbot Programs are mobile agents intended for use in widely distributed systems like the Internet. We describe our experiences implementing security, process migration, and inter-process communication in a prototype system implemented using the object-oriented programming language Python. This infrastructure supports applications that are composed of multiple, autonomous agents that can migrate to use network resources more efficiently. 1. Introduction A Knowbot ® Program is a combination of data and a thread of control that can move among nodes in a distributed system. The Knowbot Operating System provides a runtime environment for these programs which includes security mechanisms, support for migration, and facilities for communication between Knowbot Programs. Knowbot Programs enable an agent-based programming style that is well-suited for autonomous and network-efficient applications. Agents are autonomous, able to continue operation even when disconnected from their source, and can migrate closer to data or to other programs they interact with in order to conserve network bandwidth. Our work is based on the Knowbot framework, introduced by Kahn and Cerf [14], for a mobile software component to the national information infrastructure. Our experimental system explores some aspects of the Kahn-Cerf framework. This paper reviews our experience building a prototype system for supporting Knowbot Programs and reviews some of the underlying services provided by our Knowbot Operating System. It assumes a distributed object framework for communicating with other parts of the system. Our current implementation uses Python, an object oriented scripting language [21], and ILU, a multilanguage object interface system developed at Xerox PARC [10]. We use ILU to provide an object- oriented RPC mechanism for communication between objects. The KOS architecture, however, is language- and transport- neutral. 2. Overview of system services A Knowbot Program (KP) is code with well-defined entry point and state. The Knowbot Operating System (KOS) is a runtime environment that provides underlying services enabling KPs to migrate and to interact with other programs. The underlying services fall into three major categories: (1) a safe runtime environment, (2) migration and state management, and (3) communication among KPs. Each of these underlying services is described in greater detail below; they are briefly summarized here: Security. The prototype system provides several safeguards to prevent the KOS from being damaged by a KP. The KP process is divided between a supervisor, which runs trusted code provided by the KOS, and the KP user code, which is untrusted. The user code runs in a restricted execution environment, which mediates access to unsafe operations. The supervisor performs all restricted operations, like RPC calls, on behalf of the user code. Migration. A KP can move between distributed KOSes using two primitives, migrate, which moves the current program, and clone, which creates a copy of the current program at a new location. To migrate, the KOS creates a package including the KP\u0027s source code, the current state of the program, and a ``suitcase\u0027\u0027 containing application-specific data. Connectors. Connectors are a thin veneer over an object-oriented RPC mechanism that regulates the creation and publication of new objects. All connectors are named and strongly typed. A KP can lookup a particular connector by name or request a group of connectors that provide the same interface. Our use of connectors and ILU offers language independence for the Knowbot runtime environment. Any language that can support migration, has an ILU binding, and a safe way to restrict access to unsafe operations can be used to write Knowbot Programs. The rest of the paper describes our experience implementing Knowbot Programs and the underlying services. 3. Security There are several levels of security needed in a mobile agent system; they include providing secure transport for KPs between KOSes, protecting the KP from tampering by the KOS, and protecting the KOS from malicious KPs. Our current implementation addresses only the last issue -- executing the KP in safe environment. Security in the KOS is based on the strict separation of responsibilities between trusted and untrusted parts of the system. Untrusted user code runs in a restricted environment that is created for it by trusted supervisor code. The restricted environment is indistinguishable to the untrusted code running within it, with the exception that various potentially unsafe operations are inaccessible. There are many potential unsafe operations -- creating network connections, modifying files on the local",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia American search engine company For the mathematical concept, see power set. This article needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2015) Powerset Founded San Francisco, U.S. (2005) Headquarters San Francisco, California , U.S. Parent Microsoft (as of August 1, 2008) Powerset was an American company based in San Francisco, California, that, in 2006, was developing a natural language search engine for the Internet.[1] On July 1, 2008, Powerset was acquired by Microsoft for an estimated $100 million (~$143 million in 2024).[2] Powerset was working on building a natural language search engine that could find targeted answers to user questions (as opposed to keyword based search). For example, when confronted with a question like \"Which U.S. state has the highest income tax?\", conventional search engines ignore the question phrasing and instead do a search on the keywords \"state\", \"highest\", \"income\", and \"tax\". Powerset on the other hand, attempts to use natural language processing to understand the nature of the question and return pages containing the answer. The company was in the process of \"building a natural language search engine that reads and understands every sentence on the Web\".[3] The company has licensed natural language technology from PARC, the former Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.[4] On May 11, 2008, the company unveiled a tool for searching a fixed subset of English Wikipedia using conversational phrases rather than keywords.[5] Acquisition by Microsoft: One significant milestone in Powerset\u0027s history was its acquisition by Microsoft on July 1, 2008, for an estimated $100 million. This acquisition was part of Microsoft\u0027s broader strategy to enhance its search capabilities and compete more effectively with other search engine providers, particularly Google.[6] Natural Language Search Engine: Powerset\u0027s primary focus was on developing a natural language search engine capable of understanding and interpreting user queries in a more human-like manner. Instead of simply matching keywords, Powerset aimed to comprehend the meaning behind the words, allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant search results. Technology and Partnerships: Powerset had licensed natural language technology from PARC, the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. This technology likely played a crucial role in the development of Powerset\u0027s NLP capabilities.[7] Wikipedia Search Tool: In May 2008, Powerset unveiled a search tool that allowed users to search a fixed subset of English Wikipedia using conversational phrases rather than traditional keywords. This demonstrated the potential of Powerset\u0027s NLP technology in providing more precise and relevant search results. Powerlabs [edit] In a form of beta testing, Powerset opened an online community called Powerlabs on September 17, 2007. Business Week said: \"The company hopes the site will marshal thousands of people to help build and improve its search engine before it goes public next year.\"[8] Said The New York Times: \"[Powerset Labs] goes far beyond the \u0027alpha\u0027 or \u0027beta\u0027 testing involved in most software projects, when users put a new product through rigorous testing to find its flaws. Powerset doesn’t have a product yet, but rather a collection of promising natural language technologies, which are the fruit of years of research at Xerox PARC.\"[9] Powerlabs\u0027 initial search results are taken from Wikipedia.[10] Notable people [edit] Barney Pell (born March 18, 1968, in Hollywood, California)[11] was co-founder and CEO of Powerset. Pell received his Bachelor of Science degree in symbolic systems from Stanford University in 1989, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was a National Merit Scholar. Pell received a PhD in computer science from Cambridge University in 1993, where he was a Marshall Scholar.[12] He has worked at NASA, as chief strategist and vice president of business development at StockMaster.com (acquired by Red Herring in March, 2000) and at Whizbang! Labs. Prior to joining Powerset, Pell was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley.[13] Pell is also a founder of Moon Express, Inc., a U.S. company awarded a $10M commercial lunar contract by NASA and a competitor in the Google Lunar X PRIZE.[14] Steve Newcomb was the COO and co-founder of Powerset. Prior to joining Powerset, he was a co-founder of Loudfire, General Manager at Promptu, and was on the board of directors at Jaxtr. He left Powerset in October 2007 to form Virgance, a social startup incubator. Lorenzo Thione (born in Como, Italy) was the product architect and co-founder of Powerset. Prior to joining Powerset, he worked at FXPAL[13] in natural language processing and related research fields. Thione earned his master\u0027s degree in software engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.[13] Ronald Kaplan, former manager of",

See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate. The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of massive quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do ",

Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

AlltheWeb (sometimes referred to as FAST or FAST Search[1]) was an Internet search engine. It originated from FTP Search, the doctorate thesis project of Tor Egge at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Egge began the work in 1994, and it later led to the creation of Fast Search \u0026 Transfer (FAST), founded on July 16, 1997. AlltheWeb launched in mid-1999. It was acquired by Yahoo in 2003. Yahoo stut it down in 2011.[2] Traits [edit] When AlltheWeb started in 1999, FAST aimed to provide their database to other search engines, major portals, ISPs and content sites.[3] By August 2, 1999, the AlltheWeb database had grown to 200 million unique URLs.[3] By June 2002, their crawler had indexed over 2 billion pages.[4] AlltheWeb claimed a few advantages over Google, such as a fresher database, more advanced search features, search clustering and a completely customizable look.[4][5][6] Closure [edit] In February 2003, FAST\u0027s web search division was bought by Overture for $70 million.[7] In July 2003, Overture was acquired by Yahoo!, putting AlltheWeb under the ownership of Yahoo!.[8] Shortly after Yahoo!\u0027s acquisition, the AlltheWeb site started using Yahoo!\u0027s database and some of the advanced functions were removed, such as FTP search and direct image search.[citation needed] In May 2006, Yahoo! started testing live search results on AlltheWeb.[9] On April 4, 2011, AlltheWeb was shut down by Yahoo!.[10] See also [edit] List of search engines References [edit] ^ \"Short History of Early Search Engines – The History of SEO\". www.thehistoryofseo.com.

Goo is operated by the Japanese NTT Resonant, a subsidiary of NTT Communications.[1] The name is derived from the phrase, \"global network continues to expand to infinity ∞\". The site\u0027s mascot is a goat named Megu-tan.[2] History [edit] Commercial operation [edit] NTT-X was established as an operating company in 1999, and goo began full-fledged operation. In May goo started \"goo shop\", a shopping mall, a tie-up with Recruit, a joint project with Nikkei Newspaper Inc., an Internet research project jointly with Mitsubishi Research Institute, further enhanced as a portal. Goo\u0027s most popular service, \"goo dictionary\" started as the portal\u0027s free dictionary service in partnership with Sanseido. It was then working with rival Yahoo! JAPAN. Goo search results were displayed on Yahoo! JAPAN where there was no applicable search result. In 2004 and beyond, the search engine and information provision service of the portal site of the NTT provider such as OCN, Plala, WAKWAK, etc. are often using goo\u0027s search engine.[citation needed] In 2001, Goo opened a child-friendly counterpart to its search engine known as Kids Goo (キッズgoo). However, this service was closed on March 31, 2017.[3] \"Teach me! Goo\" was a user participation type Q \u0026 A site, 2.88 million monthly visitors (as of January 2007), formerly partnered with \"OK Wave\".[citation needed] Other services included \"environmental goo\", goo blog, content distribution of the former BROBA. Goo was operated by 300 people as of 2015.[citation needed] On April 14, 2025, Goo announced that \"Oshiete! Goo\", a Q\u0026A website, and \"Goo Blog\", a blog hosting service, will be closed on September 17 and November 18 respectively. \"Oshiete! Goo\" launched in 2000, while \"Goo Blog\" launched in 2004.[4] In May, Goo announced that \"Goo Dictionary\", running since 1999, will be closed on June 25, 2025.[5] Domain dispute [edit] Popcorn, of Kurashiki City in Okayama Prefecture, acquired the domain name goo.co.jp in August 1996. Although the domain acquisition at that time had been operating as a non-adult site where the schoolgirl on the theme, goo.ne.jp became famous. In 1999 an adult site opened at that address. In November 2000 NTT-X, then goo\u0027s operating company filed a request to the Industrial Property Arbitration Center (currently the Japan Intellectual Property Arbitration Center) to relocate the domain, and in January 2001 the centre ordered the transfer of the domain. Popcorn complained about this and raised an application for domain usage to the Tokyo District Court in opposition to NTT-X in February 2001. The Tokyo District Court offered in April 2002 a ruli",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia System to sort undesirable contributions Comment moderation on a GitHub discussion, where a user called Mallory has deleted several comments before closing the discussion and locking it Content moderation, in the context of websites that facilitate user-generated content, is the systematic process of identifying, reducing,[1] or removing user contributions that are irrelevant, obscene, illegal, harmful, or insulting. This process may involve either direct removal of problematic content or the application of warning labels to flagged material. As an alternative approach, platforms may enable users to independently block and filter content based on their preferences.[2] This practice operates within the broader domain of trust and safety frameworks. Various types of Internet sites permit user-generated content such as posts, comments, videos including Internet forums, blogs, and news sites powered by scripts such as phpBB, a wiki, PHP-Nuke, etc. Depending on the site\u0027s content and intended audience, the site\u0027s administrators will decide what kinds of user comments are appropriate, then delegate the responsibility of sifting through comments to lesser moderators. Most often, they will attempt to eliminate trolling, spamming, or flaming, although this varies widely from site to site. Major platforms use a combination of algorithmic tools, user reporting and human review.[2] Social media sites may also employ content moderators to manually flag or remove content flagged for hate speech, incivility or other objectionable content. Other content issues include revenge porn, graphic content, child abuse material and propaganda.[2] Some websites must also make their content hospitable to advertisements.[2] In the United States, content moderation is governed by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and has seen several cases concerning the issue make it to the United States Supreme Court, such as the current Moody v. NetChoice, LLC. Content moderation can result in a range of outcomes, including blocking and visibility moderation such as shadow banning.[3] Content moderation together with parental controls can help parents filter age appropriateness of content for their children.[4] Supervisor moderation [edit] Also known as unilateral moderation, this kind of moderation system is often seen on Internet forums. A group of people are chosen by the site\u0027s administrators (usually on a long-term basis) to act as delegates, enforcing the community rules on their behalf. These moderators are given special privileges to delete or edit others\u0027 contributions and/or exclude people based on their e-mail address or IP address, and generally attempt to remove negative contributions throughout the community.[5] Commercial content moderation [edit] Commercial Content Moderation is a term coined by Sarah T. Roberts to describe the practice of \"monitoring and vetting user-generated content (UGC) for social media platforms of all types, in order to ensure that the content complies with legal and regulatory exigencies, site/community guidelines, user agreements, and that it falls within norms of taste and acceptability for that site and its cultural context\".[6] Industrial composition [edit] The content moderation industry is estimated to be worth US$9 billion. While no official numbers are provided, there are an estimates 10,000 content moderators for TikTok; 15,000 for Facebook and 1,500 for Twitter as of 2022.[7] The global value chain of content moderation typically includes social media platforms, large MNE firms and the content moderation suppliers. The social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google) are largely based in the United States, Europe and China. The MNEs (e.g. Accenture, Foiwe) are usually headquartered in the global north or India while suppliers of content moderation are largely located in global southern countries like India and the Philippines.[8]: 79–81  While at one time this work may have been done by volunteers within the online community, for commercial websites this is largely achieved through outsourcing the task to specialized companies, often in low-wage areas such as India and the Philippines. Outsourcing of content moderation jobs grew as a result of the social media boom. With the overwhelming growth of users and UGC, companies needed many more employees to moderate the content. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, tech companies began to outsource jobs to foreign countries that had an educated workforce but were willing to work for cheap.[9] Working conditions [edit] Employees work by viewing, assessing and deleting disturbing content.[10] Wired reported in 2014, they may suffer psychological damage.[11][12][13][5][14] In 2017, the Guardian reported secondary trauma may arise, with symptoms similar to PTSD.[15] Some large companies such as Facebook offer psychological support[15] and increasingly rely on the use of artificial intelligence to ",

See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

A9.com office in Palo Alto, CA Company type Search Engine Industry Communications Founded 2004 Founder Udi Manber[1] Headquarters Palo Alto, California Parent Amazon A9.com was a subsidiary of Amazon that developed search engine and search advertising technology. A9 was based in Palo Alto, California, with teams in Seattle, Bangalore, Beijing, Dublin, Iași, Munich and Tokyo. A9 had development efforts in areas of product search, cloud search, visual search, augmented reality, advertising technology and community question answering. History [edit] A9, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, was founded in 2003 with an exclusive focus on producing technology for search and advertising. Initially located in the Wells Fargo building on Hamilton Avenue, in 2004 they moved into the building previously used by the DEC Systems Research Center in Palo Alto, California. One purpose of A9.com was to leverage algorithms, and the name was chosen as a numeronym to represent that word (i.e. \u0027A\u0027 + 9 other letters). The office was in Silicon Valley, near Stanford University.[2] Under the direction of its first president, Udi Manber, A9 focused on several areas, including the A9.com destination website, a browser toolbar, product search, and a search advertising platform. Some early A9 services such as \"search inside the book\" continued, while others have been discontinued. The A9 search engine powered product search for Amazon.com and several other eCommerce retailers. In February 2006, Manber resigned to move to Google and was replaced by David L. Tennenhouse as president.[3] In September 2006, William Stasior, one of A9\u0027s founders and a former AltaVista and Amazon.com executive, was named president. In June 2009, A9 acquired SnapTell, which developed smartphone-based visual search applications.[4] Stasior left in October 2012 to join Apple Inc. to work on Siri.[5] Brian Pinkerton, who had developed WebCrawler in the 1990s, became general manager of A9 in 2012.[6][7] Brian Pinkerton was replace by Srikanth Thirumalai, who left when A9 became Amazon Search. In 2019, after reporting from The Wall Street Journal revealed that Amazon had changed its search algorithm to favor more profitable products, Amazon took down the A9.com site and pointed the domain name to Amazon\u0027s home page.[8] Projects [edit] A9.com search portal [edit] A9.com originally operated a search portal, along with an A9 toolbar, which was first demonstrated on April 14, 2004.[9] The service featured some innovative design elements, allowing users to choose from over 400 sources to search and view results in separate columns grouped by source. In addition to web search results, users could get product search results from Amazon, encyclopedia results from Wikipedia, movie information from IMDb, and others, starting in September 2004.[10] Web search results were provided by different search engines over time. The search portal functionality was discontinued in 2008. OpenSearch [edit] A9 developed a protocol called OpenSearch that enabled the \"plug-in\" search source functionality from the A9.com portal. The original specification, OpenSearch 1.0, was released in March 2005. A9 made the protocol freely available through a Creative Commons license. BlockView [edit] A9 developed the first service that allowed users of maps and \"yellow pages\" (a telephone directory) to view buildings at street level. Called BlockView, the service was announced in January 2005.[11] Within a year, the service included images for 24 US cities. Both BlockView and maps (as well as support for the A9 tool bar) were discontinued in September 2006.[12] Clickriver [edit] In November 2006, A9 announced Clickriver, an advertising program that let third parties place advertisements on Amazon.com pages.[13] Clickriver focused primarily on products and services that complemented Amazon\u0027s own offerings. For example, if a customer viewed a television on Amazon, a Clickriver ad might offer installation services in his or her local area. Clickriver was discontinued in 2010, replaced by other Amazon advertising programs. Community question answering [edit] A9 operated Askville, a community-based question-and-answer site first tested in December 2006. Service began in November 2007.[14] Compared with other question-and-answer sites, Askville focused more on social interaction, allowing users to follow other users as well as track specific topics. On October 25, 2013, Askville was shut down.[15] CloudSearch [edit] CloudSearch is a managed Amazon Web Services service that makes client data searchable.[16] For example, a business that wanted to allow customers to search their catalog could upload the catalog entries to CloudSearch and then route search requests from their application or web site to the service. CloudSearch instances could be brought online as data or traffic volume demanded. Sites us",

That being said, Google\u0027s John Mueller took it a step up by saying using these services may hurt your rankings. In a Google Webmaster Help thread John responded to a webmaster who was asking \"mass website submissions to search engines,\" and asked if it will have any impact on their rankings. John from Google said, yes, it may, it may have a negative impact. Why? John explained that it can lead to a tremendous number of unnatural links for your site. As you know, unnatural links can more than ever have a negative impact on your site. Despite the concerns with negative SEO, this is the reality we live in these days. So yea, it sounds like in some cases you can use these services to negatively impact your competitors, assuming their link profile looks horrible anyway?

Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through a character string called uniform resource locator (URL). The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs), which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information on the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organisations, government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information. The Web has become the world\u0027s dominant information systems platform.[7][8][9][10] It is the primary tool that billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.[3] History [edit] Main article: History of the World Wide Web This NeXT Computer was used by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and became the world\u0027s first Web server. The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.[11][12] He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organisation, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN. In his design, Berners-Lee dismissed the common tree structure approach, used for instance in the existing CERNDOC documentation system and in the Unix filesystem, as well as approaches that relied on tagging files with keywords, as in the VAX/NOTES system. Instead, he adopted concepts he had put into practice with his private ENQUIRE system (1980), built at CERN. When he became aware of Ted Nelson\u0027s hypertext model (1965), in which documents can be linked in unconstrained ways through hyperlinks associated with \"hot spots\" embedded in the text, it helped to confirm the validity of his concept.[13][14] The former World Wide Web logo, designed by Robert Cailliau. Currently, there is no widely accepted logo in use for the WWW. The model was later popularised by Apple\u0027s HyperCard system. Unlike Hypercard, Berners-Lee\u0027s new system from the outset was meant to support links between multiple databases on independent computers, and to allow simultaneous access by many users from any computer on the Internet. He also specified that the system should eventually handle other media besides text, such as graphics, speech, and video. Links could refer to mutable data files, or even fire up programs on their server computer. He also conceived \"gateways\" that would allow access through the new system to documents organised in other ways (such as traditional computer file systems or the Usenet). Finally, he insisted that the system should be decentralised, without any central control or coordination over the creation of links.[5][15][11][12] Berners-Lee submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name.[5] He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN.

Its stated mission is to \"help the academic community use digital technologies to preserve the scholarly record and to advance research and teaching in sustainable ways\".[3] Ithaka was founded in 2003 by Kevin M. Guthrie.[4] Ithaka\u0027s total revenue was $105 million in 2019, most of it ($79 million) from JSTOR service fees.[5] History [edit] JSTOR was founded in 1995 under the direction of current ITHAKA president Kevin M. Guthrie. Guthrie also served as the founding president of ITHAKA in 2004.[1] Both organizations were initially funded by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which at the time was led by William G. Bowen.[6] The two organizations announced that they would merge in 2009 after years of working together closely.[7] The organizations stated that the merger was \"a natural progression\" and that they would work together to help \"academic institutions use digital technology to enhance scholarship and teaching and reduce system-wide costs through collective action.\"[8] Services [edit] JSTOR [edit] Main article: JSTOR JSTOR is a major database of academic research materials, with content that includes books, journals, and primary sources. Portico [edit] Portico was created by JSTOR in 2002 as the Electronic-Archiving Initiative. It was transferred to ITHAKA in 2004. Portico operates as a \"\u0027dim\u0027 archive for e-journal content\" that stores information from scholarly journals so it cannot be lost, an example being when the part of it housing the Graft: Organ and Cell Transplantation journal was \"lit up\" and became publicly accessible after access to that journal\u0027s website was removed by its publisher.[9] In 2019, Portico generated $6.3 million in revenue.[5] Ithaka S+R [edit] Ithaka S+R is a research and consulting service that releases public research reports and offers consulting services to libraries, publishers, scholarly societies, universities, and other non-profit organizations.[10] Ithaka S+R conducts triennial surveys of faculty members and library directors in the United States.[11][12] In 2019, Ithaka S+R generated $1.8 million in revenue.[5] Awards [edit] The same year that Ithaka Harbors obtained Portico, the Library of Congress gave a $3 million NDIIPP grant to the company for it to \"develop, test, and operate one or more electronic archives for electronic journals\", along with providing \"long-term access to those journals\". The endeavor was known as the Portico Project.[13] The National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services named Ithaka Harbors as one of the four recipients of their 2008 Digital Partnership grant awards. The company was chosen because of its Protecting Future Access Now: Developing a Prototype Preservation Model for Digital Books project, which is meant to be a \"prototype preservation service that will provide a practical model for the preservation of digitized books.\"[14] Ithaka Harbors received federal contract awards in 2010 and 2011. The former was $75,000 given by the US Department of Labor for their \"Archived E-journal Collections\".[15] A year later, the Department of the Army awarded $17,000 for collection additions of \"books, maps and other publications\".[16] Notable trustees [edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

For the use of ISSNs on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:ISSN. International Standard Serial Number Acronym ISSN Organisation ISSN International Centre Introduced 1976; 49 years ago (1976) No. issued \u003e 2,500,000 No. of digits 8 Check digit Weighted sum Example 2049-3630 Website www.issn.org ISSN for Vers Domain, encoded in an EAN-13 barcode with sequence variant 0 and issue number 05 Example of an ISSN, 2049-3630, encoded in an EAN-13 bar code, with explanation ISSN expanded with sequence variant 0 to a GTIN-13 and encoded in an EAN-13 barcode with an EAN-2 add-on designating issue number 13 An International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an eight-digit code to uniquely identify a periodical publication (periodical), such as a magazine.[1] The ISSN is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title. ISSNs are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature.[2] The ISSN system was first drafted as an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) international standard in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975.[3] ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for maintaining the standard. When a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type, a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in print and electronic media. The ISSN system refers to these types as print ISSN (p-ISSN) and electronic ISSN (e-ISSN).[4] Consequently, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned a linking ISSN (ISSN-L), typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium.[5] Code format [edit] An ISSN is an eight-digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers.[1] The last digit, which may be zero through nine or an X, is a check digit, so the ISSN is uniquely represented by its first seven digits. Formally, the general form of the ISSN (also named \"ISSN structure\" or \"ISSN syntax\") can be expressed as follows:[6] NNNN-NNNC where N is in the set {0,1,2,...,9}, a decimal digit character, and C is in {0,1,2,...,9,X}; or by a Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) regular expression: ^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3}[0-9X]$. For example, the ISSN of the journal Hearing Research, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, that is C\u003d5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used: Each of the first seven digits of the ISSN is multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right, that is, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, respectively, and the resulting products are added: 0 ⋅ 8 + 3 ⋅ 7 + 7 ⋅ 6 + 8 ⋅ 5 + 5 ⋅ 4 + 9 ⋅ 3 + 5 ⋅ 2 \u003d 0 + 21 + 42 + 40 + 20 + 27 + 10 \u003d 160 . {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\u00260\\cdot 8+3\\cdot 7+7\\cdot 6+8\\cdot 5+5\\cdot 4+9\\cdot 3+5\\cdot 2\\\\\u0026\u003d0+21+42+40+20+27+10\\\\\u0026\u003d160\\;.\\end{aligned}}} The remainder of this sum modulo 11 is then calculated: 160 11 \u003d 14 remainder 6 \u003d 14 + 6 11 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {160}{11}}\u003d14{\\mbox{ remainder }}6\u003d14+{\\frac {6}{11}}} If there is no remainder, the check digit is 0; otherwise the remainder is subtracted from 11. If the result is less than 10, it yields the check digit: 11 − 6 \u003d 5 . {\\displaystyle 11-6\u003d5\\;.} Thus, in this example, the check digit C is 5. If the result is 10 (that is, if the remainder is 1), the check digit is an uppercase X (like a Roman ten). To confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by their position in the number, counting from the right. (If the check digit is X, add 10 to the sum.) The remainder of the sum modulo 11 must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN, based on the above algorithm.[citation needed] In EANs [edit] ISSNs can be encoded in EAN-13 bar codes with a 977 \"country code\" (compare the 978 \"bookland\" country code for ISBNs), followed by the 7 main digits of the ISSN (the check digit is not included), followed by 2 publisher-defined digits, followed by the EAN check digit (in most cases, this will not match the ISSN check digit, since they are each calculated in a different way).[7] Code assignment, maintenance and look-up [edit] ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres, usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre (CIEPS[8]) based in Paris. The International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between UNESCO and the French government. Linking ISSN [edit] ISSN-L is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media. As defined by ISO 3297:2007, the \"linking ISSN (ISSN-L)\" provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different",

The site offers news, satire, blogs, and original content, and covers politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy eating, young women\u0027s interests, and local news featuring columnists.[4] It was created to provide a progressive alternative to conservative news websites such as the Drudge Report.[5][6] The site contains its own content and user-generated content via video blogging, audio, and photo.[7] In 2012, the website became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize.[8] Founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti,[6][9] the site was launched on May 9, 2005, as a counterpart to the Drudge Report.[10] In March 2011, it was acquired by AOL for US$315 million, with Arianna Huffington appointed editor-in-chief.[11][12] In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion, and the site became a part of Verizon Media.[13] In November 2020, BuzzFeed acquired the company.[14] Weeks after the acquisition, BuzzFeed laid off 47 HuffPost staff, mostly journalists, in the U.S.[15] and closed down HuffPost Canada, laying off 23 staff working for the Canadian and Quebec divisions of the company.[16] History [edit] The Huffington Post was launched on May 9, 2005, as a commentary outlet, blog, and an alternative to news aggregators such as the Drudge Report.[17][18][3] It was founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti.[6] Prior to this, Arianna Huffington hosted the website Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was the website Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton.[19] An early Huffington Post strategy was crafting search-engine optimized (SEO) stories and headlines based around trending keywords, such as \"What Time Is the Super Bowl?\"[20] In August 2006, The Huffington Post raised a $5 million Series A round from SoftBank Capital and Greycroft.[21] In December 2008, The Huffington Post raised $25 million from Oak Investment Partners at a $100 million valuation and Fred Harman of Oak Investment Partners joined its board of directors.[22][23][24] The money was to be used for technology, infrastructure, investigative journalism, and development of local versions.[25][26] In June 2009, Eric Hippeau, co-managing partner of Softbank Capital, became CEO of The Huffington Post.[27] In January 2011, The Huffington Post received 35% of its traffic from web search engines (SEOs), compared to 20% at CNN.[28] This strategy appealed to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who tried to implement similar SEO-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of The Huffington Post.[29][30][28] In March 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for US$315 million.[31][32] As part of the deal, Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post and existing AOL properties Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater (now subpage on the HuffPost Entertainment subpage), AOL Music, AOL Latino (now HuffPost Voices), AutoBlog, Patch, and StyleList.[12] In December 2011, The Huffington Post said it had 36.2 million unique visitors.[33] The Huffington Post subsumed many of AOL\u0027s Voices properties, including AOL Black Voices, which was established in 1995 as Blackvoices.com, and AOL Latino, Impact (launched in 2010 as a partnership between Huffington Post and Causecast), Women, Teen, College, Religion, and the Spanish-language Voces (en español). The Voices brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of Gay Voices, dedicated to LGBT-relevant articles.[34][35] By late 2013, the website operated as a \"stand-alone business\" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing \"premium advertising\".[36] In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media.[13] Huffington resigned to pursue other",

    "title": "Iterative method - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Iterative algorithm) Algorithm in which each approximation of the solution is derived from prior approximations In computational mathematics, an iterative method is a mathematical procedure that uses an initial value to generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions for a class of problems, in which the i-th approximation (called an \"iterate\") is derived from the previous ones. A specific implementation with termination criteria for a given iterative method like gradient descent, hill climbing, Newton\u0027s method, or quasi-Newton methods like BFGS, is an algorithm of an iterative method or a method of successive approximation. An iterative method is called convergent if the corresponding sequence converges for given initial approximations. A mathematically rigorous convergence analysis of an iterative method is usually performed; however, heuristic-based iterative methods are also common. In contrast, direct methods attempt to solve the problem by a finite sequence of operations. In the absence of rounding errors, direct methods would deliver an exact solution (for example, solving a linear system of equations A x \u003d b {\\displaystyle A\\mathbf {x} \u003d\\mathbf {b} } by Gaussian elimination). Iterative methods are often the only choice for nonlinear equations. However, iterative methods are often useful even for linear problems involving many variables (sometimes on the order of millions), where direct methods would be prohibitively expensive (and in some cases impossible) even with the best available computing power.[1] Attractive fixed points [edit] If an equation can be put into the form f(x) \u003d x, and a solution x is an attractive fixed point of the function f, then one may begin with a point x1 in the basin of attraction of x, and let xn+1 \u003d f(xn) for n ≥ 1, and the sequence {xn}n ≥ 1 will converge to the solution x. Here xn is the nth approximation or iteration of x and xn+1 is the next or n + 1 iteration of x. Alternately, superscripts in parentheses are often used in numerical methods, so as not to interfere with subscripts with other meanings. (For example, x(n+1) \u003d f(x(n)).) If the function f is continuously differentiable, a sufficient condition for convergence is that the spectral radius of the derivative is strictly bounded by one in a neighborhood of the fixed point. If this condition holds at the fixed point, then a sufficiently small neighborhood (basin of attraction) must exist. Linear systems [edit] In the case of a system of linear equations, the two main classes of iterative methods are the stationary iterative methods, and the more general Krylov subspace methods. Stationary iterative methods [edit] Introduction [edit] Stationary iterative methods solve a linear system with an operator approximating the original one; and based on a measurement of the error in the result (the residual), form a \"correction equation\" for which this process is repeated. While these methods are simple to derive, implement, and analyze, convergence is only guaranteed for a limited class of matrices. Definition [edit] An iterative method is defined by x k + 1 :\u003d Ψ ( x k ) , k ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} ^{k+1}:\u003d\\Psi (\\mathbf {x} ^{k}),\\quad k\\geq 0} and for a given linear system A x \u003d b {\\displaystyle A\\mathbf {x} \u003d\\mathbf {b} } with exact solution x ∗ {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} ^{*}} the error by e k :\u003d x k − x ∗ , k ≥ 0. {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {e} ^{k}:\u003d\\mathbf {x} ^{k}-\\mathbf {x} ^{*},\\quad k\\geq 0.} An iterative method is called linear if there exists a matrix C ∈ R n × n {\\displaystyle C\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{n\\times n}} such that e k + 1 \u003d C e k ∀ k ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {e} ^{k+1}\u003dC\\mathbf {e} ^{k}\\quad \\forall k\\geq 0} and this matrix is called the iteration matrix. An iterative method with a given iteration matrix C {\\displaystyle C} is called convergent if the following holds lim k → ∞ C k \u003d 0. {\\displaystyle \\lim _{k\\to \\infty }C^{k}\u003d0.} An important theorem states that for a given iterative method and its iteration matrix C {\\displaystyle C} it is convergent if and only if its spectral radius ρ ( C ) {\\displaystyle \\rho (C)} is smaller than unity, that is, ρ ( C ) \u003c 1. {\\displaystyle \\rho (C)\u003c1.} The basic iterative methods work by splitting the matrix A {\\displaystyle A} into A \u003d M − N {\\displaystyle A\u003dM-N} and here the matrix M {\\displaystyle M} should be easily invertible. The iterative methods are now defined as M x k + 1 \u003d N x k + b , k ≥ 0 , {\\displaystyle M\\mathbf {x} ^{k+1}\u003dN\\mathbf {x} ^{k}+\\mathbf {b} ,\\quad k\\geq 0,} or, equivalently, x k + 1 \u003d x k + M − 1 ( b − A x k ) , k ≥ 0. {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} ^{k+1}\u003d\\mathbf {x} ^{k}+M^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf {b} -A\\mathbf {x} ^{k}\\right),\\quad k\\geq 0.} From this follows that the iteration matrix is given by C \u003d I − M − 1 A \u003d M − 1 N . {\\displaystyle C\u003dI-M^{-1}A\u003dM^{-1}N.} Examples [edit] Basic examples of stationary iterative methods use a splitting of the matrix A {\\displayst",

Naver Co., Ltd. Logo used from 2018 Trade name NAVER Company type Subsidiary Industry Internet Artificial intelligence Cloud computing Founded 2 June 1999; 26 years ago (1999-06-02)[1] Founder Lee Hae-jin Headquarters Seongnam-si , Korea Area served Worldwide Products NAVER Mail NAVER Map NAVER News Parent Naver Corporation Korean name Hangul 네이버 주식회사 RR Neibeo jusikhoesa MR Neibŏ chusikhoesa Website www.naver.com Naver (Korean: 네이버; stylized as NAVER) is a South Korean online platform operated by the Naver Corporation. The company\u0027s products include a search engine, email hosting, blogs, maps, and mobile payment.[1] History [edit] Naver was the first Korean web provider to develop its own search engine. The company was founded on 2 June 1999, and is headquartered in Seongnam, South Korea. Naver is a combination of \u0027navigate\u0027 and the suffix \u0027-er\u0027, referring to a person who navigates the vast ocean of information on the Internet.[2] Naver provides community services including blogs and cafes, other convenient services such as knowledge, shopping, maps, books, e-mail, and a Naver toolbar.[1] In August 2000, Naver launched its \u0027comprehensive search\u0027 service, which allows users to get a variety of results from a single search query on one page, organized by type, including blogs, websites, images, and web communities.[citation needed] Naver became an early pioneer in user-generated content through the creation of the \u0027Knowledge iN\u0027 (네이버 지식인)\u0027 service in 2002.[citation needed] In Knowledge iN, users can pose questions on any subject and select from answers provided by other users, awarding points to those who give the best answers. Knowledge iN was launched three years before Yahoo! introduced its similar \u0027Yahoo! Answers\u0027 service[3] and now possesses a database of over 200 million answers. Bradley Horowitz, former Vice President of Product Strategy at Yahoo!, has cited Knowledge iN as the inspiration for Yahoo! Answers, which was launched three years after Naver introduced the original service.[4] Over the years, Naver has continued to expand its services. Naver Blog started with the name \u0027paper\u0027 in June 2003 and evolved to \u0027blog\u0027 in October 2003.[5] \u0027Webtoon\u0027 is a South Korean webtoon publisher launched in 2004 by Naver.[6] In May 2005, Naver started the Real-time Search service. The rising search terms was a chart in Naver that highlighted trending topics in real-time.[citation needed] The top searches would appear on the portal main page, reaching a large number of users.[7] From 2005 to 2007, Naver expanded its multimedia search services, including music and video search, as well as mobile search.[citation needed] Naver had launched a messaging app called Line for the South Korean market in February 2011.[8] In 2019, Naver reorganized its mobile version of the main screen, excluding search windows and some menus.[citation needed] In response, more than 3,000 comments opposing the change were posted.[9] In October 2023, Naver announced the beta release of its AI chatbot service, \u0027CLOVA X\u0027 (클로바X).[10] Naver mobile map application began providing real-time service on natural disaster information on 15 September 2024.[11] Services [edit] Naver Dictionary [edit] Main article: Naver Dictionary Naver Dictionary was launched in 1999, alongside Naver. It initially supported only Korean and English.[12] As of 2024[update], it supports 67 languages.[13] The dictionary aggregates results from a number of other dictionaries, including Urimalsaem, which is operated by the National Institute of Korean Language.[14] It also aggregates results from English-language dictionaries such as Oxford Dictionary of English[15] and the Collins English Dictionary.[16] It also operates an open-source dictionary called Open Dictionary PRO (ODP).[14] Junior Naver [edit] Junior Naver (쥬니어 네이버), also known as Juniver (쥬니버), is a portal website for children, similar to Yahooligans. Junior Naver offers services such as avatars, educational content, quizzes, videos, Q\u0026A, and a homework helper. It uses a panel of experts and educators to filter out harmful content, ensuring a safe internet environment for children. With its competitors Daum Kids and Yahoo Kids having closed down, Junior Naver is now the only children\u0027s portal site operating in Korea.[citation needed] Knowledge iN [edit] Knowledge iN (지식iN), formerly Knowledge Search (지식검색), is an online Q\u0026A platform launched in October 2002.[17] The tool allows users to ask any question and receive answers from other users. Naver became an early pioneer in user-generated content through the creation of the \u0027Knowledge iN\u0027 (네이버 지식인)\u0027 service in 2002.

(March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The process of frequency weighting involves emphasizing the contribution of particular aspects of a phenomenon (or of a set of data) over others to an outcome or result; thereby highlighting those aspects in comparison to others in the analysis. That is, rather than each variable in the data set contributing equally to the final result, some of the data is adjusted to make a greater contribution than others. This is analogous to the practice of adding (extra) weight to one side of a pair of scales in order to favour either the buyer or seller. While weighting may be applied to a set of data, such as epidemiological data, it is more commonly applied to measurements of light, heat, sound, gamma radiation, and in fact any stimulus that is spread over a spectrum of frequencies. Weighting in acoustics [edit] Weighting and loudness [edit] In the measurement of loudness, for example, a weighting filter is commonly used to emphasise frequencies around 3 to 6 kHz where the human ear is most sensitive, while attenuating very high and very low frequencies to which the ear is insensitive. A commonly used weighting is the A-weighting curve, which results in units of dBA sound pressure level. Because the frequency response of human hearing varies with loudness, the A-weighting curve is correct only at a level of 40-phon and other curves known as B-, C- and D-weighting are also used, the latter being particularly intended for the measurement of aircraft noise. Weighting in audio measurement [edit] In broadcasting and audio equipment measurements 468-weighting is the preferred weighting to use because it was specifically devised to allow subjectively valid measurements on noise, rather than pure tones. It is often not realised that equal loudness curves, and hence A-weighting, really apply only to tones, as tests with noise bands show increased sensitivity in the 5 to 7 kHz region on noise compared to tones. Other weighting curves are used in rumble measurement and flutter measurement to properly assess subjective effect. In each field of measurement, special units are used to indicate a weighted measurement as opposed to a basic physical measurement of energy level. For sound, the unit is the phon (1 kHz equivalent level). In the fields of acoustics and audio engineering, it is common to use a standard curve referred to as A-weighting, one of a set that are said to be derived from equal-loudness contours. Application to hearing in aquatic animals [edit] Auditory frequency weighting functions for marine mammals were introduced by Southall et al. (2007).[1] Weighting in electromagnetism [edit] Weighting and gamma rays [edit] In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body but letting through those that do the most damage, so any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its strength. The resulting unit is the sievert or microsievert. Weighting and television colour components [edit] Another use of weighting is in television, in which the red, green and blue components of the signal are weighted according to their perceived brightness. This ensures compatibility with black and white receivers and also benefits noise performance and allows separation into meaningful luminance and chrominance signals for transmission. Weighting and UV factor derivation for sun exposure [edit] Skin damage due to sun exposure is very wavelength dependent over the UV range 295 to 325 nm, with power at the shorter wavelength causing around 30 times as much damage as the longer one. In the calculation of UV Index, a weighting curve is used which is known as the McKinlay-Diffey Erythema action spectrum.[1] Archived 2010-06-13 at the Wayback Machine See also [edit] Audio ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Set of web pages that can undermine web crawlers For trapping real spiders, see Insect trap. A spider trap (or crawler trap) is a set of web pages that may intentionally or unintentionally be used to cause a web crawler or search bot to make an infinite number of requests or cause a poorly constructed crawler to crash. Web crawlers are also called web spiders, from which the name is derived. Spider traps may be created to \"catch\" spambots or other crawlers that waste a website\u0027s bandwidth. They may also be created unintentionally by calendars that use dynamic pages with links that continually point to the next day or year. Common techniques used include: Creation of indefinitely deep directory structures such as http://example.com/abc/def/abc/def/abc/def/abc/... Dynamic pages that produce an unbounded number of documents for a web crawler to follow. Examples include calendars[1] and algorithmically generated language poetry.[2] Documents filled with many characters, crashing the lexical analyzer parsing the document. Documents with session-id\u0027s based on required cookies. There exists no universal algorithm capable of detecting all spider traps. While certain categories of traps can be identified through automated methods, novel and previously unrecognized traps continue to emerge rapidly. Politeness [edit] A spider trap causes a web crawler to enter something like an infinite loop,[3] which wastes the spider\u0027s resources,[4] lowers its productivity, and, in the case of a poorly written crawler, can crash the program. Polite spiders alternate requests between different hosts, and do not request documents from the same server more than once every several seconds,[5] meaning that a \"polite\" web crawler is affected to a much lesser degree than an \"impolite\" crawler.[citation needed] In addition, sites with spider traps usually have a robots.txt telling bots not to go to the trap, so a legitimate \"polite\" bot would not fall into the trap, whereas an \"impolite\" bot which disregards the robots.txt settings would be affected by the trap.[6] See also [edit] Robots exclusion standard Web crawler References [edit] ^ \"\"What is a Spider Trap?\"\".

(June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

For other uses, see Image (disambiguation). \"Picture\" redirects here. For other uses, see Picture (disambiguation). For Wikipedia image use guidelines, see Wikipedia:Images. The act of making a 2D image with a mobile phone camera. The display of the phone shows the photograph that will be made and stored. An image or picture is a visual representation. An image can be two-dimensional, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, or three-dimensional, such as a carving or sculpture. Images may be displayed through other media, including a projection on a surface, activation of electronic signals, or digital displays; they can also be reproduced through mechanical means, such as photography, printmaking, or photocopying. Images can also be animated through digital or physical processes. In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).[1] In optics, the term image (or optical image) refers specifically to the reproduction of an object formed by light waves coming from the object.[2] A volatile image exists or is perceived only for a short period. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode-ray tube. A fixed image, also called a hard copy, is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile.[1] A mental image exists in an individual\u0027s mind as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image does not need to be real; it may be an abstract concept such as a graph or function or an imaginary entity. For a mental image to be understood outside of an individual\u0027s mind, however, there must be a way of conveying that mental image through the words or visual productions of the subject. Characteristics [edit] A synthetic aperture radar image acquired by the SIR-C/X-SAR radar on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour shows the Teide volcano. The city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is visible as the purple and white area on the lower right edge of the island. Lava flows at the summit crater appear in shades of green and brown, while vegetation zones appear as areas of purple, green, and yellow on the volcano\u0027s flanks. Two-dimensional images [edit] The broader sense of the word \u0027image\u0027 also encompasses any two-dimensional figure, such as a map, graph, pie chart, painting, or banner.[clarification needed] In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing, the art of painting, or the graphic arts (such as lithography or etching). Additionally, images can be rendered automatically through printing, computer graphics technology, or a combination of both methods. A two-dimensional image does not need to use the entire visual system to be a visual representation. An example of this is a grayscale (\"black and white\") image, which uses the visual system\u0027s sensitivity to brightness across all wavelengths without taking into account different colors. A black-and-white visual representation of something is still an image, even though it does not fully use the visual system\u0027s capabilities. On the other hand, some processes can be used to create visual representations of objects that are otherwise inaccessible to the human visual system. These include microscopy for the magnification of minute objects, telescopes that can observe objects at great distances, X-rays that can visually represent the interior structures of the human body (among other objects), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET scans), and others. Such processes often rely on detecting electromagnetic radiation that occurs beyond the light spectrum visible to the human eye and converting such signals into recognizable images. Three-dimensional images [edit] Aside from sculpture and other physical activities that can create three-dimensional images from solid material, some modern techniques, such as holography, can create three-dimensional images that are reproducible but intangible to human touch. Some photographic processes can now render the illusion of depth in an otherwise \"flat\" image, but \"3-D photography\" (stereoscopy) or \"3-D film\" are optical illusions that require special devices such as eyeglasses to create the illusion of depth. Moving images [edit] See also: Film \"Moving\" two-dimensional images are actually illusions of movement perceived when still images are displayed in sequence, each image lasting less, and sometimes much less, than a fraction of a second. The traditional standard for the display of individual frames by a motion picture projector has been 24 frames per second (FPS) since at least the commercial introduction of \"talking pictures\" in the late 1920s, which necessitated a standard for synchronizing images and sounds.[citation needed] Even in electronic formats such as television and digita",

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Distributed web crawling\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (July 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Distributed web crawling is a distributed computing technique whereby Internet search engines employ many computers to index the Internet via web crawling. Such systems may allow for users to voluntarily offer their own computing and bandwidth resources towards crawling web pages. By spreading the load of these tasks across many computers, costs that would otherwise be spent on maintaining large computing clusters are avoided. Types [edit] Cho[1] and Garcia-Molina studied two types of policies: Dynamic assignment [edit] With this type of policy, a central server assigns new URLs to different crawlers dynamically. This allows the central server to, for instance, dynamically balance the load of each crawler.[2] With dynamic assignment, typically the systems can also add or remove downloader processes. The central server may become the bottleneck, so most of the workload must be transferred to the distributed crawling processes for large crawls. There are two configurations of crawling architectures with dynamic assignments that have been described by Shkapenyuk and Suel:[3] A small crawler configuration, in which there is a central DNS resolver and central queues per Web site, and distributed downloaders. A large crawler configuration, in which the DNS resolver and the queues are also distributed. Static assignment [edit] With this type of policy, there is a fixed rule stated from the beginning of the crawl that defines how to assign new URLs to the crawlers. For static assignment, a hashing function can be used to transform URLs (or, even better, complete website names) into a number that corresponds to the index of the corresponding crawling process.[4] As there are external links that will go from a Web site assigned to one crawling process to a website assigned to a different crawling process, some exchange of URLs must occur. To reduce the overhead due to the exchange of URLs between crawling processes, the exchange should be done in batch, several URLs at a time, and the most cited URLs in the collection should be known by all crawling processes before the crawl (e.g.: using data from a previous crawl).[1] Implementations [edit] As of 2003, most modern commercial search engines use this technique. Google and Yahoo use thousands of individual computers to crawl the Web. Newer projects are attempting to use a less structured, more ad hoc form of collaboration by enlisting volunteers to join the effort using, in many cases, their home or personal computers. LookSmart is the largest search engine to use this technique, which powers its Grub distributed web-crawling project. Wikia (now known as Fandom) acquired Grub from LookSmart in 2007.[5] This solution uses computers that are connected to the Internet to crawl Internet addresses in the background. Upon downloading crawled web pages, they are compressed and sent back, together with a status flag (e.g. changed, new, down, redirected) to the powerful central servers. The servers, which manage a large database, send out new URLs to clients for testing. Drawbacks [edit] According to the FAQ about Nutch, an open-source search engine website, the savings in bandwidth by distributed web crawling are not significant, since \"A successful search engine requires more bandwidth to upload query result pages than its crawler needs to download pages...\".[6] See also [edit] Distributed computing Web crawler YaCy - P2P web search engine with distributed crawling Seeks - Open-Source P2P Web Search Sources [edit] ^ a b Cho, Junghoo; Garcia-Molina, Hector (2002). \"Parallel crawlers\".

Find sources: \"Search engine manipulation effect\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (May 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Effect of search engines on user attitudes The search engine manipulation effect (SEME) is a term invented by psychologist Robert Epstein in 2015 to describe a hypothesized change in consumer preferences and voting preferences by search engines. Rather than search engine optimization where advocates, websites, and businesses seek to optimize their placement in the search engine\u0027s algorithm, SEME focuses on the search engine companies themselves. According to Epstein, search engine companies both massively manipulate consumer and vote sentiment, and furthermore do so to ensure their favored candidates win. Epstein’s research shows that such manipulations can shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more, and up to 80 percent in some demographics, and can change the outcomes in over 25% of national elections.[1][2][3] In response to the allegations, Google denied re-ranking search results to manipulate user sentiment, or tweaking ranking specially for elections or political candidates.[4] Scenarios [edit] At least three scenarios offer the potential to shape/decide elections. The management of a search engine could pick a candidate and adjust search rankings accordingly. Alternatively, a rogue employee who has sufficient authority and/or hacking skills could surreptitiously adjust the rankings. Finally, since rankings influence preferences even in the absence of overt manipulation, the ability of a candidate to raise his or her ranking via traditional search engine optimization would influence voter preferences. Simple notoriety could substantially increase support for a candidate.[2] Experiments [edit] Five experiments were conducted with more than 4,500 participants in two countries. The experiments were randomized (subjects were randomly assigned to groups), controlled (including groups with and without interventions), counterbalanced (critical details, such as names, were presented to half the participants in one order and to half in the opposite order) and double-blind (neither subjects nor anyone who interacted with them knows the hypotheses or group assignments). The results were replicated four times.[2] United States [edit] In experiments conducted in the United States, the proportion of people who favored any candidate rose by between 37 and 63 percent after a single search session.[2] Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which search rankings favored either Candidate A, Candidate B or neither candidate. Participants were given brief descriptions of each candidate and then asked how much they liked and trusted each candidate and whom they would vote for. Then they were allowed up to 15 minutes to conduct online research on the candidates using a manipulated search engine. Each group had access to the same 30 search results—each linking to real web pages from a past election. Only the ordering of the results differed in the three groups. People could click freely on any result or shift between any of five different results pages.[2] After searching, on all measures, opinions shifted in the direction of the candidate favored in the rankings. Trust, liking and voting preferences all shifted predictably.[5] 36 percent of those who were unaware of the rankings bias shifted toward the highest ranked candidate, along with 45 percent of those who were aware of the bias.[2] Slightly reducing the bias on the first result page of search results – specifically, by including one search item that favoured the other candidate in the third or fourth position masked the manipulation so that few or even no subjects noticed the bias, while still triggering the preference change.[6] Later research suggested that search rankings impact virtually all issues on which people are initially undecided around the world. Search results that favour one point of view tip the opinions of those who are undecided on an issue. In another experiment, biased search results shifted people\u0027s opinions about the value of fracking by 33.9 per cent.[6] India [edit] A second experiment involved 2,000 eligible, undecided voters throughout India during the 2014 Lok Sabha election. The subjects were familiar with the candidates and were being bombarded with campaign rhetoric. Search rankings could boost the proportion of people favoring any candidate by more than 20 percent and more than 60 percent in some demographic groups.[2] Unite",

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Local search\" Internet – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (September 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Use of specialized Internet search engines Local search is the use of specialized Internet search engines that allow users to submit geographically constrained searches against a structured database of local business listings. Typical local search queries include not only information about \"what\" the site visitor is searching for (such as keywords, a business category, or the name of a consumer product) but also \"where\" information, such as a street address, city name, postal code, or geographic coordinates like latitude and longitude. Examples of local searches include \"Hong Kong hotels\", \"Manhattan restaurants\", and \"Dublin car rental\". Local searches exhibit explicit or implicit local intent.[1] A search that includes a location modifier, such as \"Bellevue, WA\" or \"14th arrondissement\", is an explicit local search. A search that references a product or service that is typically consumed locally, such as \"restaurant\" or \"nail salon\", is an implicit local search. Local searches on Google Search typically return organic results prefaced with a \u0027local 3-pack\u0027, a list of three local results. More local results can be obtained by clicking on “more places” under the 3-pack. The list of results one obtains is also called the Local Finder.[2] Search engines and directories are primarily supported by advertising from businesses that wish to be prominently featured when users search for specific products and services in specific locations. Google for instance, has developed local inventory ads and features ads in the local pack.[3] Local search advertising can be highly effective because it allows ads to be targeted very precisely to the search terms and location provided by the user. Evolution [edit] Local search is the natural evolution of traditional offline advertising, typically distributed by newspaper publishers and TV and radio broadcasters, to the Web. Historically, consumers relied on local newspapers and local TV and radio stations to find local products and services. With the advent of the Web, consumers are increasingly using search engines to find these local products and services online. In recent years, the number of local searches online has grown rapidly while off-line information searches, such as print Yellow Page lookups, have declined.[4] As a natural consequence of this shift in consumer behavior, local product, and service providers are slowly shifting their advertising investments from traditional off-line media to local search engines. Of directories, search engines and maps [edit] One can search for local information via search engines. These often return local search results from directories[5] and maps. Google for instance, will present results from its directory (called Google Business Profile) in Google Maps and also in the search engine results pages[6] in the form of a local pack. One can also look for local information by searching Apple Maps[7] Search engines offer local businesses the possibility to upload their business data to their respective local search databases.[8] Other local search engines adjunct to major web search portals include general Windows Live Local, Yahoo! Local, and ask.com\u0027s AskCity. Yahoo!, for example, separates its local search engine features into Yahoo! Local and Yahoo! Maps, the former being focused on business data and correlating it with web data, the latter focused primarily on the map features (e.g. directions, larger map, navigation). Local search, like ordinary search, can be applied in two ways. As John Battelle coined it in his book \"The Search,\" search can be either recovery search or discovery search. This perfect search also has perfect recall – it knows what you’ve seen, and can discern between a journey of discovery – where you want to find something new – and recovery – where you want to find something you’ve seen before. This applies especially to local searches. Recovery search implies, for example, that a consumer knows who she is looking for (i.e., Main Street Pizza Parlor) but she does not know where they are, or needs their phone number. Discovery search implies that the searcher knows, for example, what she wants but not who she needs it from (i.e., pizza on Main Street in Springfield). In February 2012, Google announced that they made 40 changes to their search algorithm, including one codenamed \"Venice\" which Google states will improve local search results by \"relying more on the ranking of (Google\u0027s) main search results as a signal\",[9] meaning local search will now rely more on organic SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages).

(June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Sogou, Inc. (Chinese: 搜狗; pinyin: Sōugǒu; lit. \u0027Search-dog\u0027) is a Chinese technology company and subsidiary of Tencent. It started as Sohu’s search division, later becoming a separate company, and stayed under Sohu’s control until Tencent acquired it.[1] The offices of Sogou are located in Beijing on the southeast corner of Tsinghua University. Sogou also has offices in Chengdu, co-located within Tencent\u0027s office building. In April 2018, Sogou established a R\u0026D center in Guangzhou. History [edit] Wang Xiaochuan was hired by Sohu.com after graduating from Tsinghua University and tasked to create a new search engine. He continued to lead a small team of students from the nearby Tsinghua University on the project. The Sogou search engine was launched on August 3, 2004, and operated as a separate division within Sohu. In 2006, Sogou invented Sogou Pinyin, the eventual dominant input platform used in China for both desktop PC and mobile.[2] In 2007, Sogou established a search curriculum with Tsinghua University to recruit future engineers and stimulate development. Wang Xiaochuan is known as the \"Goalie of the East Gate\" for the relentless recruitment from Tsinghua.[citation needed] In 2008, Sogou launched the Sogou Browser. By 2010, search revenue share was under 1%. Wang Xiaochuan flew to meet Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba.com and convinced him of an equity investment. In return, Sohu.com agreed to spin Sogou from a separate division to an independent company, with a separate P\u0026L line. Pre-IPO stock options were granted to employees for the first time. By 2012, growth had risen by over 300% and Sohu.com purchased shares back from Jack Ma. It started to seek out new partnerships by 2013. Wang Xiaochuan met with Pony Ma, CEO of Tencent, and convinced him of a merger. The search engine SoSo.com merged with Sogou and an equity investment of US$448 million was made. By 2014, Sogou became the default search engine for QQ.com. Also, in 2014, Sogou became the only search engine to be able to search WeChat public accounts. By early 2015, Sogou became profitable. Sogou debuted on New York Stock Exchange on 9 November 2017, under the ticker \"SOGO\".[3] The IPO raised $585 million offering in a bid to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in its business.[4] In 2018, Sogou reported net sales of $1.1 billion, a net income of $98 million, and reported over $1 billion in cash. Their annual growth rate was 24% over the previous year. In late July 2020, Chinese technology company Tencent made a $2.1 billion bid to buy Sogou, with the decision to accept and regulatory permissions still pending.[5] According to iResearch statistics, Sogou accounted for 16.7% of the mobile search market share in China.[6] Products [edit] Sogou 搜狗 Available in Chinese URL sogou.com Commercial Yes Users 560 million Launched 3 August 2004; 21 years ago (2004-08-03) Current status Active Search engine and web applications [edit] Sogou\u0027s web application products are designed to classify online information, such as music, picture, video clip, news, map and vertical information. As of 2017, it has an index of 10 billion pages. As of 2018, over 90% of the company\u0027s revenues are from search advertising. In October 2017, Sogou began testing a general search engine within WeChat, which would allow users to access the internet within the app. Since 2013, Sogou has only been able to search and index the contents of WeChat official accounts. On the first quarter conference call, 2018, Sogou provided an update, resulting in a 30% improvement in click through rate. In September 2018, Sogou disclosed an annual agreement with Tencent to continue the search integration experiment until 2023, with annual renewals. In the same filing, Sogou has designated the default search engine for Tencent\u0027s QQ products. Sogou Input Method [edit] Main article: Sogou Pinyin Initially released in 2006, Sogou Pinyin makes use of its search engine technique which are the analysis and categorization of the most popular words or phrases on the Internet.

For other uses, see Home page (disambiguation). \"Start page\" redirects here. For the Windows GUI element, see Start menu. For the Dutch search engine, see Startpage. The home page of the English Wikipedia (in 2023) is displayed in a web browser. The small house-shaped button in the upper left is for the browser\u0027s start page. A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website.[1] Usually, the home page is located at the root of the website\u0027s domain or subdomain. For example, if the domain is example.com, the home page is likely located at the URL www.example.com/. The term may also refer to the start page shown in a web browser when the application first opens.[2] Function A home page is the main web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors.[3] In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages. Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website;[4] for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.[5][6] According to Homepage Usability, the home page is the \"most important page on any website\" and receives the most views of any page.[7] A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site.[6] One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.[8] Browser start page When a web browser is launched, it will automatically open at least one web page. This is the browser\u0027s start page, which is also called its home page.[2][9] Start pages can be a website or a special browser page, such as thumbnails of frequently visited websites. Moreover, there is a niche market of websites intended to be used solely as start pages.[9] See also Wikimedia Commons has media related to Home pages.

Carnegie Mellon fields eight men\u0027s teams and nine women\u0027s teams as the Tartans.[16] The university\u0027s faculty and alumni include 21 Nobel Prize laureates and 13 Turing Award winners and have received 142 Emmy Awards, 64 Tony Awards, and 13 Academy Awards.[17] History [edit] Andrew Carnegie, founder of the Carnegie Technical Schools Andrew Mellon, co-founder of the Mellon Institute The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[18] by the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who wrote \"My heart is in the work\", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie\u0027s vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887.[19] In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women. The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon (who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father, Thomas Mellon, patriarch of the Mellon family. The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within the University of Pittsburgh. In 1927, the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute\u0027s iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue.[20] In 1967, with support from Paul Mellon, the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon\u0027s coordinate women\u0027s college, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic program",

Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the network, forming a peer-to-peer network of nodes.[1] In addition, a personal area network (PAN) is also in nature a type of decentralized peer-to-peer network typically between two devices.[2] The opposite of a peer-to-peer network: based on the client–server model, where individual clients request services and resources from centralized servers Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage, or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.[3] Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client–server model in which the consumption and supply of resources are divided.[4] While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains,[5] the architecture was popularized by the Internet file sharing system Napster, originally released in 1999.[6] P2P is used in many protocols such as BitTorrent file sharing over the Internet[7] and in personal networks like Miracast displaying and Bluetooth radio.[8] The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. In such social contexts, peer-to-peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society, enabled by Internet technologies in general. Development [edit] SETI@home was established in 1999. While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains,[5] the concept was popularized by file sharing systems such as the music-sharing application Napster. The peer-to-peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect \"directly, forming groups and collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual supercomputers, and filesystems\".[9] The basic concept of peer-to-peer computing was envisioned in earlier software systems and networking discussions, reaching back to principles stated in the first Request for Comments, RFC 1.[10] Tim Berners-Lee\u0027s vision for the World Wide Web was close to a P2P network in that it assumed each user of the web would be an active editor and contributor, creating and linking content to form an interlinked \"web\" of links. The early Internet was more open than the present day, where two machines connected to the Internet could send packets to each other without firewalls and other security measures.[11][9][page needed] This contrasts with the broadcasting-like structure of the web as it has developed over the years.[12][13][14] As a precursor to the Internet, ARPANET was a successful peer-to-peer network where \"every participating node could request and serve content\". However, ARPANET was not self-organized, and it could not \"provide any means for context or content-based routing beyond \u0027simple\u0027 address-based routing.\"[14] Therefore, Usenet, a distributed messaging system that is often described as an early peer-to-peer architecture, was established. It was developed in 1979 as a system that enforces a decentralized model of control.[15] The basic model is a client–server model from the user or client perspective that offers a self-organizing approach to newsgroup servers. However, news servers communicate with one another as peers to propagate Usenet news articles over the entire group of network servers. The same consideration applies to SMTP email in the sense that the core email-relaying network of mail transfer agents has a peer-to-peer character, while the periphery of Email clients and their direct connections is strictly a client-server relationship.[16] In May 1999, with millions more people on the Internet, Shawn Fanning introduced the music and file-sharing application called Napster.[14] Napster was the beginning of peer-to-peer networks, as we know them today, where \"participating users establish a virtual network, entirely independent from the physical network, without having to obey any administrative authorities or restrictions\".[14] Architecture [edit] A peer-to-peer network is designed around the notion of equal peer nodes simultaneously functioning as both ",

What\u0027s hard is knowing what it is you\u0027re measuring and what your measurement can mean. Web searches test the understanding of the WP:Five pillars of Wikipedia. A search engine lists web pages on the Internet. This facilitates research by offering an immediate variety of applicable options. Possibly useful items on the results list include the source material or the electronic tools that a web site can provide, such as a dictionary, but the list itself, as a whole, can also indicate important information. However, discerning that information may require insight. Search engine results can help editors retain (what is notable) or delete (what is not verifiable) source material, depending on their reliability. There is a high demand for reliability on Wikipedia. Discerning the reliability of the source material is an especially core skill for using the web, while the wiki itself only facilitates the creation of multiple drafts. As presentations and deletions progress, this variety of choices for input tend to produce the desired objective—a neutral viewpoint. Depending on the type of query and kind of search engine, this variety can open up to a single author. Some search engine tests Popularity – See Google\u0027s trending tool below or a regular Google search and use of the \"Tools\" button. Usage – Identify a term\u0027s notability. (See for example Google\u0027s ngram tool.) Genuineness – Identify a spurious hoax or an urban legend. Notability – Decide whether a page should be nominated for deletion. Existence – Discover what sources (including websites) actually exist for possible presentation. Information – Review the reliability of facts and citations. Names and terminology – Identify the names used for things (including alternative names and terminology). Copyrighting – Identify whether material is copied, and if so, check the licensing. This page describes both these web search tests and the web search tools that can help develop Wikipedia, and it describes their biases and their limitations. The advantages of a specific search engine can be distinguished by using a variety of common search engines. The distinct advantages of each are their user interface and, less obviously, their algorithms for compiling and searching their own indexes. Because a web crawler can be blocked—specific ones or just in general—different search engines can list different web sites, and there are more web sites available by URL than are indexed in any database. The most common search engines are Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Specialized search engines exist for medicine, science, news and law amongst others. Several generalized search engines exist. These adapt your query to many search engines. See § Common search engines below. This page mostly uses Google instead of Bing or Yahoo, but aims for generality where it can.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Online information retrieval tool Architecture of a metasearch engine A metasearch engine (or search aggregator) is an online information retrieval tool that uses the data of a web search engine to produce its own results.[1][2] Metasearch engines take input from a user and immediately query search engines[3] for results. Sufficient data is gathered, ranked, and presented to the users. Problems such as spamming reduce the accuracy and precision of results.[4] The process of fusion aims to improve the engineering of a metasearch engine.[5] Examples of metasearch engines include Skyscanner and Kayak.com, which aggregate search results of online travel agencies and provider websites. SearXNG is a generic free and open-source search software which aggregates results from internet search engines and other sources like Wikipedia and is offered for free by more than 70 SearXNG providers.[6] History [edit] The first person to incorporate the idea of meta searching was University of Washington student Eric Selberg,[7] who published a paper about his MetaCrawler experiment in 1995. The search engine is still usable as of 2024.[8] On May 20, 1996, HotBot, then owned by Wired, was a search engine with search results coming from the Inktomi and Direct Hit databases. It was known for its fast results and as a search engine with the ability to search within search results. Upon being bought by Lycos in 1998, development for the search engine staggered and its market share fell drastically. After going through a few alterations, HotBot was redesigned into a simplified search interface, with its features being incorporated into Lycos\u0027 website redesign.[9] In 1997, Daniel Dreilinger published a paper on his experimental metasearch engine, SavvySearch, which was able to automatically select the correct search engine to prioritize based on prior experience.[10] A metasearch engine called Anvish was developed by Bo Shu and Subhash Kak in 1999; the search results were sorted using instantaneously trained neural networks.[11] This was later incorporated into another metasearch engine called Solosearch.[12] In August 2000, India got its first meta search engine when HumHaiIndia.com was launched.[13] It was developed by the then 16 year old Sumeet Lamba.[14] The website was later rebranded as Tazaa.com.[15] Ixquick is a search engine known for its privacy policy statement. Developed and launched in 1998 by David Bodnick, it is owned by Surfboard Holding BV. In June 2006, Ixquick began to delete private details of its users following the same process with Scroogle. Ixquick\u0027s privacy policy includes no recording of users\u0027 IP addresses, no identifying cookies, no collection of personal data, and no sharing of personal data with third parties.[16] It also uses a unique ranking system where a result is ranked by stars. The more stars in a result, the more search engines agreed on the result. In April 2005, Dogpile, then owned and operated by InfoSpace, Inc., collaborated with researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University to measure the overlap and ranking differences of leading Web search engines in order to gauge the benefits of using a metasearch engine to search the web. Results found that from 10,316 random user-defined queries from Google, Yahoo!, and Ask Jeeves, only 3.2% of first page search results were the same across those search engines for a given query. Another study later that year using 12,570 random user-defined queries from Google, Yahoo!, MSN Search, and Ask Jeeves found that only 1.1% of first page search results were the same across those search engines for a given query.[17] Advantages [edit] By sending multiple queries to several other search engines this extends the coverage data of the topic and allows more information to be found. They use the indexes built by other search engines, aggregating and often post-processing results in unique ways. A metasearch engine has an advantage over a single search engine because more results can be retrieved with the same amount of exertion.[2] It also reduces the work of users from having to individually type in searches from different engines to look for resources.[2] Metasearching is also a useful approach if the purpose of the user\u0027s search is to get an overview of the topic or to get quick answers. Instead of having to go through multiple search engines like Yahoo! or Google and comparing results, metasearch engines are able to quickly compile and combine results. They can do it either by listing results from each engine queried with no additional post-processing (Dogpile) or by analyzing the results and ranking them by their own rules (IxQuick, Metacrawler, and Vivismo). A metasearch engine can also hide the searcher\u0027s IP address from the search engines queried thus providing privacy to the search. Disadvantages [edit] Metasearch engines are not capable of parsing query forms or able ",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Query entered into a web search engine A web query or web search query is a query that a user enters into a web search engine to satisfy their information needs. Web search queries are distinctive in that they are often plain text and boolean search directives are rarely used. They vary greatly from standard query languages, which are governed by strict syntax rules as command languages with keyword or positional parameters. Types [edit] There are three broad categories that cover most web search queries: informational, navigational, and transactional.[1] These are also called \"do, know, go.\"[2] Although this model of searching was not theoretically derived, the classification has been empirically validated with actual search engine queries.[3] Informational queries – Queries that cover a broad topic (e.g., colorado or trucks) for which there may be thousands of relevant results. Navigational queries – Queries that seek a single website or web page of a single entity (e.g., youtube or delta air lines). Transactional queries – Queries that reflect the intent of the user to perform a particular action, like purchasing a car or downloading a screen saver. Search engines often support a fourth type of query that is used far less frequently: Connectivity queries – Queries that report on the connectivity of the indexed web graph (e.g., Which links point to this URL?, and How many pages are indexed from this domain name?).[4] Characteristics [edit] A list of search suggestions for a search query Most commercial web search engines do not disclose their search logs, so information about what users are searching for on the Web is difficult to come by.[5] Nevertheless, research studies started to appear in 1998.[6][7] A 2001 study,[8] which analyzed the queries from the Excite search engine, showed some interesting characteristics of web searches: The average length of a query was 2.4 terms. About half of the users entered a single query while a little less than a third of users entered three or more unique queries. Close to half of the users examined only the first one or two pages of results (10 results per page). Less than 5% of users used advanced search features (e.g., boolean operators like AND, OR, and NOT). The top four most frequently used terms were (empty search), and, of, and sex. A study of the same Excite query logs revealed that 19% of the queries contained a geographic term (e.g., place names, zip codes, geographic features, etc.).[9] Studies also show that, in addition to short queries (queries with few terms), there are predictable patterns of how users change their queries.[10] A 2005 study of Yahoo\u0027s query logs revealed that 33% of the queries from the same users were repeat queries and that in 87% of cases the user would click on the same result.[11] This suggests that many users use repeat queries to revisit or re-find information. This analysis is confirmed by a Bing search engine blog post which stated that about 30% of queries are navigational queries.[12] In addition, research has shown that query term frequency distributions conform to the power law, or long tail distribution curves. That is, a small portion of the terms observed in a large query log (e.g. \u003e 100 million queries) are used most often, while the remaining terms are used less often individually.[13] This example of the Pareto principle (or 80–20 rule) allows search engines to employ optimization techniques such as index or database partitioning, caching and pre-fetching. In addition, studies have been conducted into linguistically-oriented attributes that can recognize if a web query is navigational, informational or transactional.[14] A 2011 study found that the average length of queries had grown steadily over time and the average length of non-English language queries had increased more than English ones.[15] Google implemented the hummingbird update in August 2013 to handle longer search queries since more searches are conversational (e.g. \"where is the nearest coffee shop?\").[16] Structured queries [edit] With search engines that support Boolean operators and parentheses, a technique traditionally used by librarians can be applied. A user who is looking for documents that cover several topics or facets may want to describe each of them by a disjunction of characteristic words, such as vehicles OR cars OR automobiles. A faceted query is a conjunction of such facets; e.g. a query such as (electronic OR computerized OR DRE) AND (voting OR elections OR election OR balloting OR electoral) is likely to find documents about electronic voting even if they omit one of the words \"electronic\" or \"voting\", or even both.[17] See also [edit] Information retrieval – Finding information for an information need Taxonomy for search engines User intent – A user\u0027s goal in making a search query Web query classification Web search engine References [edit] ^ Broder, A.

Find sources: \"Search engine\" computing – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this message) In computing, a search engine is an information retrieval software system designed to help find information stored on one or more computer systems. Search engines discover, crawl, transform, and store information for retrieval and presentation in response to user queries. The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called hits. The most widely used type of search engine is a web search engine, which searches for information on the World Wide Web. A search engine normally consists of four components, as follows: a search interface, a crawler (also known as a spider or bot), an indexer, and a database. The crawler traverses a document collection, deconstructs document text, and assigns surrogates for storage in the search engine index. Online search engines store images, link data and metadata for the document. How search engines work [edit] Search engines provide an interface to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items. The criteria are referred to as a search query. In the case of text search engines, the search query is typically expressed as a set of words that identify the desired concept that one or more documents may contain.[1] There are several styles of search query syntax that vary in strictness. It can also switch names within the search engines from previous sites. Whereas some text search engines require users to enter two or three words separated by white space, other search engines may enable users to specify entire documents, pictures, sounds, and various forms of natural language. Some search engines apply improvements to search queries to increase the likelihood of providing a quality set of items through a process known as query expansion. Query understanding methods can be used as standardized query language. Index-based search engine The list of items that meet the criteria specified by the query is typically sorted, or ranked. Ranking items by relevance (from highest to lowest) reduces the time required to find the desired information. Probabilistic search engines rank items based on measures of similarity (between each item and the query, typically on a scale of 1 to 0, 1 being most similar) and sometimes popularity or authority (see Bibliometrics) or use relevance feedback. Boolean search engines typically only return items which match exactly without regard to order, although the term Boolean search engine may simply refer to the use of Boolean-style syntax (the use of operators AND, OR, NOT, and XOR) in a probabilistic context. To provide a set of matching items that are sorted according to some criteria quickly, a search engine will typically collect metadata about the group of items under consideration beforehand through a process referred to as indexing. The index typically requires a smaller amount of computer storage, which is why some search engines only store the indexed information and not the full content of each item, and instead provide a method of navigating to the items in the search engine result page. Alternatively, the search engine may store a copy of each item in a cache so that users can see the state of the item at the time it was indexed or for archive purposes or to make repetitive processes work more efficiently and quickly.[2] Other types of search engines do not store an index. Crawler, or spider type search engines (a.k.a. real-time search engines) may collect and assess items at the time of the search query, dynamically considering additional items based on the contents of a starting item (known as a seed, or seed URL in the case of an Internet crawler). Meta search engines store neither an index nor a cache and instead simply reuse the index or results of one or more other search engine to provide an aggregated, final set of results. Database size, which had been a significant marketing feature through the early 2000s, was similarly displaced by emphasis on relevancy ranking, the methods by which search engines attempt to sort the best results first. Relevancy ranking first became a major issue c. 1996, when it became apparent that it was impracti",

Filter bubbles are seen as critical enablers of Brexit, Trump, Bolsonaro, and other populist political phenomena, and search and social media companies have been criticised for failing to prevent their development. Yet, there is scant empirical evidence for their existence, or for the related concept of ‘echo chambers’: indeed, search and social media users generally appear to encounter a highly centrist media diet that is, if anything, more diverse than that of non-users. However, the persistent use of these concepts in mainstream media and political debates has now created its own discursive reality that continues to impact materially on societal institutions, media and communication platforms, and ordinary users themselves. This article provides a critical review of the ‘filter bubble’ idea, and concludes that its persistence has served only to redirect scholarly attention from far more critical areas of enquiry.

Introduction In its contemporary meaning, the term ‘filter bubble’ was introduced and popularised by the US tech entrepreneur and activist Eli Pariser, most significantly in his 2011 book The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You. Pariser opens the book with an anecdote: in the spring of 2010, while the remains of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig were spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, I asked two friends to search for the term “BP.” They’re pretty similar – educated white left-leaning women who live in the Northeast. But the results they saw were quite different. One of my friends saw investment information about BP. The other saw news. For one, the first page of results contained links about the oil spill; for the other, there was nothing about it except for a promotional ad from BP. (Pariser, 2011a, p. 2) Pariser goes on to speculate that such differences are due to the algorithmic personalisation of search results that Google and similar search engines promise, and that in effect each search engine user exists in a filter bubble – a “personalized universe of information” (Pariser, 2015, n.p.) – that differs from individual to individual. This idea can therefore be seen as a far more critical counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte’s much earlier vision of the Daily Me (Negroponte, 1995), a personalised online newspaper that would cater to its reader’s specific interests rather than merely providing general-interest news and information. Such differences in the evaluation of otherwise similar concepts also demonstrate the considerably changed public perception of online services and their algorithmic shaping, from the early-Web enthusiasm of the mid-1990s to the growing technology scepticism of the 2010s. It is important to note from the outset that, in writing for a general audience and promoting his concept through TED talks and similar venues (e.g., Pariser, 2011b), Pariser largely fails to provide a clear definition for the ‘filter bubble’ concept; it remains vague and founded in anecdotes. Subsequently, this has generated significant problems for scholarly research that has sought to empirically verify the widespread existence of filter bubbles in real-life contexts, beyond anecdotal observations. This definitional blur at the heart of the concept did not prevent it from gaining considerable c",

CiteSeer\u0027s goal is to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature. As a non-profit service that can be freely used by anyone, it has been considered part of the open access movement that is attempting to change academic and scientific publishing to allow greater access to scientific literature. CiteSeer freely provided Open Archives Initiative metadata of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as DBLP and the ACM Portal. To promote open data, CiteSeerX shares its data for non-commercial purposes under a Creative Commons license.[1] CiteSeer is considered a predecessor of academic search tools such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search.[2] CiteSeer-like engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites. For this reason, authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index. CiteSeer changed its name to ResearchIndex at one point and then changed it back.[3] History [edit] CiteSeer and CiteSeer.IST [edit] CiteSeer was created by researchers Lee Giles, Kurt Bollacker and Steve Lawrence in 1997 while they were at the NEC Research Institute (now NEC Labs), Princeton, New Jersey, US. CiteSeer\u0027s goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous citation indexing to permit querying by citation or by document, ranking them by citation impact. At one point, it was called ResearchIndex. CiteSeer became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time. These included: Autonomous Citation Indexing automatically created a citation index that can be used for literature search and evaluation. Citation statistics and related documents were computed for all articles cited in the database, not just the indexed articles. Reference linking, allowing browsing of the database using citation links. Citation context showed the context of citations to a given paper, allowing a researcher to quickly and easily see what other researchers have to say about an article of interest. Related documents were shown using citation and word based measures, and an active and continuously updated bibliography is shown for each document. CiteSeer was granted a United States patent # 6289342, titled \"Autonomous citation indexing and literature browsing using citation context\", on September 11, 2001. The patent was filed on May 20, 1998, and has priority to January 5, 1998. A continuation patent (US Patent # 6738780) was filed on May 16, 2001, and granted on May 18, 2004.[citation needed] After NEC, in 2004 it was hosted as CiteSeer.IST on the World Wide Web at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, and had over 700,000 documents. For enhanced access, performance and research, similar versions of CiteSeer were supported at universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Zürich and the National University of Singapore. However, these versions of CiteSeer proved difficult to maintain and are no longer available. Because CiteSeer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata, it returns fewer citation counts than sites, such as Google Scholar, that have publisher metadata. CiteSeer had not been comprehensively updated since 2005 due to limitations in its architecture design. It had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available, usually at an author\u0027s homepage, or those submitted by an author. To overcome some of these limitations, a modular and open source architecture for CiteSeer was designed – CiteSeerX. CiteSeerX [edit] CiteSeerX replaced CiteSeer and all queries to CiteSeer were redirected. CiteSeerX[4] is a pub",

(~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Software that systematically browses the World Wide Web This article is about the Internet bot. For the search engine, see WebCrawler. \"Web spider\" redirects here; not to be confused with Spider web. \"Spiderbot\" redirects here. For the video game, see Arac (video game). Architecture of a Web crawler A web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web and that is typically operated by search engines for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).[1] Web search engines and some other websites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of other sites\u0027 web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine, which indexes the downloaded pages so that users can search more efficiently. Crawlers consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites unprompted. Issues of schedule, load, and \"politeness\" come into play when large collections of pages are accessed. Mechanisms exist for public sites not wishing to be crawled to make this known to the crawling agent. For example, including a robots.txt file can request bots to index only parts of a website, or nothing at all. The number of Internet pages is extremely large; even the largest crawlers fall short of making a complete index. For this reason, search engines struggled to give relevant search results in the early years of the World Wide Web, before 2000. Today, relevant results are given almost instantly. Crawlers can validate hyperlinks and HTML code. They can also be used for web scraping and data-driven programming. Nomenclature [edit] A web crawler is also known as a spider,[2] an ant, an automatic indexer,[3] or (in the FOAF software context) a Web scutter.[4] Overview [edit] A Web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit. Those first URLs are called the seeds. As the crawler visits these URLs, by communicating with web servers that respond to those URLs, it identifies all the hyperlinks in the retrieved web pages and adds them to the list of URLs to visit, called the crawl frontier. URLs from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies. If the crawler is performing archiving of websites (or web archiving), it copies and saves the information as it goes. The archives are usually stored in such a way they can be viewed, read and navigated as if they were on the live web, but are preserved as \u0027snapshots\u0027.[5] The archive is known as the repository and is designed to store and manage the collection of web pages. The repository only stores HTML pages and these pages are stored as distinct files. A repository is similar to any other system that stores data, like a modern-day database. The only difference is that a repository does not need all the functionality offered by a database system. The repository stores the most recent version of the web page retrieved by the crawler.[citation needed] The large volume implies the crawler can only download a limited number of the Web pages within a given time, so it needs to prioritize its downloads. The high rate of change can imply the pages might have already been updated or even deleted. The number of possible URLs crawled being generated by server-side software has also made it difficult for web crawlers to avoid retrieving duplicate content. Endless combinations of HTTP GET (URL-based) parameters exist, of which only a small selection will actually return unique content. For example, a simple online photo gallery may offer three options to users, as specified through HTTP GET parameters in the URL. If there exist four ways to sort images, three choices of thumbnail size, two file formats, and an option to disable user-provided content, then the same set of content can be accessed with 48 different URLs, all of which may be linked on the site. This mathematical combination creates a problem for crawlers, as they must sort through endless combinations of relatively minor scripted changes in order to retrieve unique content. As Edwards et al. noted, \"Given that the bandwidth for conducting crawls is neither infinite nor free, it is becoming essential to crawl the Web in not only a scalable, but efficient way, if some reasonable measure of quality or freshness is to be maintained.\"[6] A crawler must carefully choose at each step which pages to visit next. Crawling policy [edit] The behavior of a Web crawler is the outcome of a combination of policies:[7] a selection policy which states the pages to download, a re-visit policy which states when to check for changes to the pages, a politeness policy that states how to avoid overloading websites. a parallelization policy that states how to coordinate distributed web crawlers. Selection policy [edit] Given the current size of the Web, even large search engines cover only a portion of the publicly available part. A 2009 study showed even l",

SearXNG supports over 70 different search engines.[1] Similar to Searx, it does not collect information about users.[2] Instances [edit] SearXNG is server-side software, and as such is hosted by several instances, public and private. Private instances are hosted on a local network, or run on the user\u0027s desktop computer itself, and are designed to be used by one person or a small number of people. Public instances are hosted on public web servers and are designed to be used by anyone like a typical search engine.[1] A list of public instances is available at searx.space.[3] Features [edit] Categorical searching [edit] SearXNG can separate results into multiple categories, including the standard categories of \"Web, \"Images,\" \"Videos,\" and \"News,\" as well as the non-standard categories of \"Social Media,\" \"Music,\" \"Files,\" \"IT,\" and \"Science.\"[4] Engines [edit] As a metasearch engine, SearXNG functions by sending queries to upstream search engines and returning them to the user. More than 70 different search engines are supported, including Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Qwant.[1][3] SearXNG also supports \"bangs\", searching only a particular engine if an exclamation point and shortcut key are appended before the search. Using two exclamation marks, such as \"!!w\", functions like DuckDuckGo\u0027s version of bangs, redirecting to the external engine itself.[5] Privacy [edit] SearXNG removes private data from requests sent to search services.

(June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Created by Jimmy Wales URL search.wikia.com Commercial Yes Registration Optional Launched January 7, 2008; 17 years ago (2008-01-07) Current status Closed Wikia Search was a short-lived free and open-source web search engine launched by Wikia, a for-profit wiki-hosting company founded by Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley.[1] Wikia Search followed other experiments by Wikia into search engine technology and officially launched as a \"public alpha\" on January 7, 2008.[2] The roll-out version of the search interface was widely criticized by reviewers in mainstream media.[3] History [edit] On December 23, 2006, Wales made a passing comment regarding the possibility of a wiki-based internet search.[4] The result was extensive media coverage in multiple languages, in outlets like The Guardian, the Sydney Morning Herald, and online editions of Forbes and Business Week publishing the statement as an announcement, encouraging the company to re-brand and relaunch its previous search engine proposal under the temporary name of \"Search Wikia\".[5] In a later interview, Wales attempted to clarify several issues. He said that funding received from Amazon.com was not specific to the search project and also restated that Wikia and Wikipedia have separate management, even though they shared three key stakeholders. When asked whether the project was \"formally announced\", he said it was partly planned and partly a response to news coverage.[6] On January 31, 2007, at a talk given at New York University, Wales announced that Wikia plans to build a search engine rivaling those of Google and Yahoo based on the kind of collaborative cooperation which has been so successful in developing Wikipedia, arguing that \"search should be open, transparent, participatory, and democratic.\"[7] He later suggested this new approach could account for five percent of the search market.[8] On March 10, 2007, Gil Penchina, chief executive officer of Wikia, stated in an interview that the goal for the project is to get five percent of the search market and that a release date for services was not scheduled. \"We\u0027re really trying to build a movement to make search free and open and transparent,\" Penchina said. \"We have some servers up and people are hacking away.\" The free and open-source approach of utilizing programmers and users around the world is different from that used by major search providers such as Google and Yahoo, who keep most of their code secret, and could provide a search engine that lets users edit and fine tune its results.[9] On December 24, 2007, Wales announced that Wikia Search had entered \"private pre-alpha\".[10][11] On June 3, 2008, an upgraded version of Wikia Search was released with additional features such as improved screen display and facilities for users to rate, edit and enhance the search results. In particular, it offered users the possibility of adding pertinent URLs to the results displayed and deleting any misleading results with immediate effect.[12] The improvements were widely welcomed by a number of former critics.[13] In August 2008 Wikia Search launched an official version of the Wikia toolbar that can be downloaded and added on to the Firefox browser. In October 2008, WISE – Wikia Intelligent Search Extensions[14] was released. By August 2008, Wikia Search held a 0.000079% share of the search market in the U.S., compared with Google\u0027s 70.77%.[15] While Google was conducting experiments with page ranking based on user feedback around this time, Jimmy Wales stated that Google\u0027s random tests and its closed algorithm were different from the open, community-oriented crowdsourcing attempts of Wikia Search.[16] In March 2009, the project ended: \"... Wikia Search was not making its numbers. With only 10,000 unique users a month over the past six months, Wales said, it was hard to justify the resources being put into it.\"[17] As of April 16, 2009, the site was running, but with \"So long and thanks for all the fish! Have a specific question? Try wikianswers!\" near the bottom of the page. Finally on May 14, 2009, the search engine service was brought to a halt. Queries to the Wikia Search website were redirected, with a message in part stating \"The Wikia Search project has ended.\" Search engine [edit] Features [edit] The search engine\u0027s result pages provided access to three major components: a web search engine, a social network service and a wiki, which hosts so-called mini-articles Mini-articles [edit] A prominent feature of the search engine were the human-written mini articles.

The title may refer to web architects, web developers, site authors, website administrators, website owners, website coordinators, or website publishers. The term is sometimes heard in tongue-in-cheek feminine form webmistress. The duties of the webmaster may include ensuring that the web servers, hardware and software are operating accurately, designing the website, generating and revising web pages, replying to user comments, and examining traffic through the site. Webmasters \"must also be well-versed in Web transaction software, payment-processing software, and security software.\"[2] Webmasters may be generalists with HTML expertise who manage most or all aspects of Web operations. Depending on the nature of the websites they manage, webmasters typically know scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP and Perl. They may also be required to know how to configure web servers such as Apache or IIS and serve as the server administrator. An alternative definition of webmaster is a businessperson who uses online media to sell products and/or services. This broader definition covers not just the technical aspects of overseeing Web site construction and maintenance but also management of content, advertising, marketing, and order fulfillment for the Web site.[3] The term \"webmaster\" has become increasingly archaic in professional contexts. According to Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the word was in 1993, but data from books shows its use is in sharp decline.[4] A user experience study conducted by Google revealed that very few web professionals identify themselves as webmasters anymore, with most preferring titles such as \"web developer,\" \"blogger,\" \"online marketer,\" \"SEO provider,\" or \"site owner.\" In 2020, Google rebranded its \"Google Webmasters Central\" to \"Google Search Central\" to reflect this shift in terminology.[4] History [edit] The role of webmaster emerged in the early 1990s with the rapid growth of the World Wide Web. As organizations and individuals began establishing an online presence, there was an immediate need for skilled individuals who could manage both the technical infrastructure and content aspects of websites.[5] Initially, webmasters were often responsible for all aspects of a website, functioning as jack-of-all-trades professionals who handled design, programming, content creation, and server administration. The term \"webmaster\" became widely recognized and standardized following the creation of the webmaster@domain email convention, which was established as a standard contact point for website-related inquiries and technical issues. This convention was formally documented in RFC 2142, published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in May 1997.[6] In the early days of the web, webmasters typically possessed a broad range of skills, as they often worked independently or in small teams with limited resources. They needed to understand HTML, basic graphic design, server administration, and network protocols, and often had to solve problems creatively with minimal documentation or community support. The role was particularly challenging as web standards were still evolving and cross-browser compatibility issues were common. Modern evolution [edit] With the increasing complexity and specialization of web development since the late 1990s and early 2000s, the traditional role of webmaster has evolved significantly. In the early days, webmasters were responsible for all aspects of a website—from configuring and maintaining web servers, ensuring uptime, and handling software deployment, to updating content, managing database management systems, overseeing access rights, ",

For the character, see Archie Andrews. Archie Comic Publications, Inc. Founded 1939; 86 years ago (1939) (as MLJ Magazines) Founders Maurice Coyne Louis Silberkleit John L. Goldwater Country of origin United States Headquarters location Pelham, New York Key people Nancy Silberkleit (Co-CEO)[1] Victor Gorelick (editor-in-chief)[2] Jon Goldwater (CEO, publisher) Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (chief creative officer) Publication types Comic books Fiction genres Romance Superhero fiction Horror Crime fiction Adventure Comedy Action Imprints Archie Action Archie Horror Dark Circle Comics Official website archiecomics.com Archie Comic Publications, Inc. (often referred to simply as Archie Comics) is an American comic book publisher headquartered in the village of Pelham, New York.[3] The company\u0027s many titles feature the fictional teenagers Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Reggie Mantle, Sabrina Spellman, Josie and the Pussycats and Katy Keene. The company is also known for its long-running Sonic the Hedgehog comic series, which it published from 1992 until 2016. The company began in 1939 as M.L.J. Magazines, Inc., which primarily published superhero comics. The initial Archie characters were created in 1941 by publisher John L. Goldwater and artist Bob Montana,[4] in collaboration with writer Vic Bloom.[5][6][7] They first appeared in Pep Comics #22 (cover-dated Dec. 1941).[5] With the creation of Archie, publisher John Goldwater hoped to appeal to fans of the Andy Hardy films starring Mickey Rooney.[6] Archie Comics was also the title of the company\u0027s longest-running publication, the first issue appearing with a cover date of Winter 1942. Starting with issue #70, the title was shortened to simply Archie. The flagship series was relaunched from issue #1 in July 2015 with a new look and design suited for a new generation of readers, although after #32 it reverted to its historic numbering with #699.[8] Archie Comics characters and concepts have also appeared in numerous films, television programs, cartoons, and video games. History [edit] Independent era [edit] M.L.J. Magazines [edit] 1939–1946: early years [edit] Pep Comics #36 Pep Comics #67 Ginger #1 Maurice Coyne, Louis Silberkleit, and John L. Goldwater formed M.L.J. Magazines, Inc., and started publishing in September 1939. The company name was derived from the initials of the partners\u0027 first names.[9] Coyne served as M.L.J.\u0027s bookkeeper and CFO. Coyne and Silberkleit had been partners in Columbia Publications, a pulp company that published its last issue in 1960. Silberkleit had a college degree from St. John\u0027s University, was a licensed and registered pharmacist, and had a law degree from New York Law School. His efforts were focused on the business, printing, separating, distribution and financial ends of the company. John Goldwater served as editor-in-chief. Goldwater was one of the founders of the Comics Magazine Association of America, and he served as its president for 25 years. (The Comics Magazine Association of America is best known to comic fans for its Comics Code Authority.) Goldwater was also a national commissioner of the Anti-Defamation League.[10] M.L.J.\u0027s first comic book, published in September 1939 (with a November cover date), was Blue Ribbon Comics with the first half full color and the last half in red and white tints. The first issue featured Rang-a-Tang the Wonder Dog. In November 1939 (with a January 1940 cover date), Pep Comics debuted with the Shield, the first US patriotic comic book hero, created by writer and managing editor Harry Shorten and designed by artist Irv Novick. Top Notch Comics was launched in December 1941. Until March 1944, the cover feature of Pep was the Shield when Archie took over the cover. The Shield was a forerunner for Joe Simon\u0027s and Jack Kirby\u0027s Captain America, being published 13 months earlier.[6][11] Archie Comics [edit] 1946–1990s [edit] The Andy Hardy movies were an inspiration for Goldwater to have a comic book about a relatable normal person. Teenaged Archibald \"Archie\" Andrews debuted with Betty Cooper and Jughead Jones in Pep Comics #22 (Dec. 1941), in a story by writer Vic Bloom and artist Bob Montana.[6] Archie soon became M.L.J. Magazines\u0027 headliner, which led to the company changing its name to Archie Comic Publications in 1946. Siberkleit and Coyne discontinued Columbia Publications.[6] In the late 1950s, Archie Publishing launched its \"Archie Adventure Series\" line with a new version of the Shield and two new characters.[9] The February 1962 issue of Harvey Kurtzman\u0027s Help! magazine featured his parody of the Archie characters in its Goodman Beaver story, \"Goodman Goes Playboy\", which was illustrated by frequent collaborator Will Elder.[12] Help! publisher Jim Warren received a letter on December 6, 1961",

It was conceptualized and developed in 1996 by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen, based in Berkeley, California. The original software was designed and implemented by Gary Chevsky. Warthen, Chevsky and Justin Grant then led the GUI development team, leading to the initial launch under the brand name of AskJeeves.com. In 2006, the \"Jeeves\" name was discontinued, and it became the Ask.com web search engine, which had its own webcrawler and algorithm.[3] In late 2010, faced with insurmountable competition from larger search engines, the company outsourced its web search technology, and revived its function as a question and answer site.[4] Three venture capital companies, Highland Capital Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, and The RODA Group were early investors.[5] Ask.com is currently owned and operated by major U.S. media company InterActiveCorp (IAC), which acquired the Ask Media Group in 2005.[6][7] History [edit] 3D render of Jeeves Ask.com was originally known as Ask Jeeves,[8] \"Jeeves\" being the name of a \"gentleman\u0027s personal gentleman\", or valet, fetching answers to any question asked. The character was named after Jeeves, Bertie Wooster\u0027s valet in the fictional works of P. G. Wodehouse.[1] The original concept of Ask Jeeves was to allow users to get answers to questions in everyday, natural language, and traditional keyword searching. Throughout its history, Ask was particularly well known for its answer functionality on the topics of mathematics, vocabulary, and unit conversion. Authors also contributed general articles about various other topics, similar to an encyclopedia. As other InterActiveCorp publications were gradually connected with the Ask software, articles on thousands of topics became accessible. Ask Jeeves was launched as a beta version during mid-April 1997 and was initiated completely on June 1, 1997.[8] On September 18, 2001, Ask Jeeves acquired Teoma for more than $1.5 million.[9] In July 2005, Ask Jeeves was acquired by IAC.[6][7] In February 2006, the name \"Jeeves\" was dropped from Ask Jeeves, and the search engine renamed Ask.[3][6] On May 16, 2006, Ask implemented a \"Binoculars Site Preview\" into its search results. On search results pages, the \"binoculars\" let searchers have a preview of the page they could visit with a mouse-over activating a pop-up screenshot. On June 5, 2007, Ask.com was redesigned with a 3D appearance.[10] In December 2007, Ask released the AskEraser feature,[11] allowing users to opt-out from tracking of search queries and IP and cookie values. They also announced they would erase this data after 18 months if the AskEraser option was not set. HTTP cookies must be enabled for AskEraser to function.[12][13] An Ask.com search of Wikipedia, 2016 On July 4, 2008, Ask acquired Lexico Publishing Group, which owns Dictionary.com, Thesaurus.com, and Reference.com.[14][15] In August 2008, Ask initiated the Ask Kids search engine designed for children.[7] In April 2009, for the UK version of Ask.com, Jeeves was redesigned as a CGI character and the website was named once again Ask Jeeves, though international versions were still just Ask.com.[16] His image remained on the UK website until July 21, 2016, though the Ask Jeeves name would continue to be used until September 21, 2016, when the website was renamed Ask. On July 26, 2010, Ask.com released a closed-beta Q\u0026A service. The service was released to the public on July 29, 2010.[17] Ask.com initiated its mobile Q\u0026A application for the iPhone during late 2010.[18] Ask.com reached 100 million global users per month in 2012[19] through its website with more than 2 million downloads of its flagship mobile app in that year.[20] The company has also released additional applications developed from its Q\u0026A experience, including Ask Around[21] in 2011 and PollRoll[22] in 2012. Search crawler shut-down [edit] In 2010, Ask.com shuttered its in-house web search engine service, which was replaced by a new Ask search engine created by third-party developer.[23] The restructuring programme included the termination of all development on the Ask.com webcrawler, the outsourcing of most web search operations, and the loss of 130 search engineering jobs. The company cited market headwinds and intense competition from larger rivals, such as Google and Yahoo.[23] Earlier in the year, Ask had initiate",

There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Inktomi Corporation Company type Public Traded as Nasdaq: INKT Founded January 1996; 29 years ago (1996-01)[1] Founder Eric Brewer[1] Paul Gauthier[1] Fate Acquired by Yahoo! Headquarters Foster City, California[1] Key people David C. Peterschmidt[2] (Chairman \u0026 CEO) Revenue $112 million (2002) Net income -$500 million (2002) Total assets $145 million (2002) Total equity $46 million (2002) Number of employees 200 (November 2002) Footnotes / references [3] Inktomi Corporation was an American Internet service provider (ISP) software developer based in Foster City, California. Customers included Microsoft, HotBot, Amazon.com, eBay, and Walmart.[3] The company developed Traffic Server, a proxy server web cache for World Wide Web traffic and on-demand streaming media which transcoded images down to a smaller size for users of dial-up Internet access. Traffic Server was deployed by several large ISPs including AOL.[4] In 2003, after the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the company was acquired by Yahoo! for $241 million. The company\u0027s name, pronounced \"INK-tuh-me\", was derived from a Lakota legend about the trickster spider Iktomi, known for his ability to outsmart larger adversaries.[1] The tri-color nested cube logo was created by Tom Lamar in 1996. History [edit] Inktomi was founded in January 1996 by University of California, Berkeley professor Eric Brewer and graduate student Paul Gauthier at the University of California, Berkeley. The company was initially founded based on the web search engine that was developed at the university.[1] HotBot was the first search engine that made use of Inktomi\u0027s search technology.[5] 1998 to 1999 [edit] In June 1998, the company raised $36 million in an initial public offering.[6] Its success in making HotBot the top rated search engine led to Microsoft, Yahoo! and Disney all partnering with Inktomi.[7] In September 1998, the company acquired C2B Technologies for $95 million in stock, adding shopping engine technology to its portfolio.[8] In November 1998, the company raised additional capital at a 688% premium to its IPO price five months earlier.[9] In March 1999, CEO David Peterschmidt said that Inktomi would become an \"arms merchant\" to a growing number of content delivery network service providers.[10] Inktomi received revenue based on a percentage of sales and/or a pay per click model. In April 1999, the company acquired Impulse Buy Network, adding 400 merchants to its shopping engine.[11] In November 1999, the company acquired Webspective, which developed technology for content management across a host of distributed servers to be used in load balancing, for $106 million in stock.[12] 21st century [edit] In March 2000, the company\u0027s stock peaked at a price of $241 per share.[13] In August 2000, the company acquired Ultraseek Server from The Walt Disney Company\u0027s Go.com.[14] In September 2000, the company acquired FastForward Networks, which developed software for the distribution of live streaming media over the Internet using \"app-level\" multicast technology, for $1.3 billion in stock.[15] In December 2000, the company acquired the Content Bridge Business Unit from Adero, a content delivery network, which had formed the Content Bridge Alliance with Inktomi and other ISPs, hosting providers and IP transport providers in August 2000.[16][17] An article written by Danny Sullivan for Search Engine Watch on October 1, 2001, revealed that Inktomi accidentally allowed the public to access its database of spam websites, which contained over one million of such sites, through a search result on competing search engine AllTheWeb.[18][19][20] The database was found by Brett Tabke, who ran the Search Engine World website.[20] In July 2001, the company acquired eScene Networks, which developed software that provided an integrated workflow for the management and publishing of video content.[21] In 2002, after the burst of the dot-com bubble, the company was restructured by Keyur Patel who joined Inktomi as investor, and senior vice president, strategy, marketing and technology.[22] His restructuring led to the sale of the Ultraseek Server product (renamed Inktomi Enterprise Search) to Verity in late 2002 and the sale of the rest of the company to Yahoo!\u0027s Yahoo! Search for $1.63 per share, or $241 million, completed on March 19, 2003.[23][24] In 2006, the technology behind the Inktomi Proxy Server was acquired by Websense, which was modified and included in the Websense Security Gateway. In 2009, Yahoo! donated the Traffic Server technology to the Apache Software Foundation.[25] References [edit] ^ a b c d e f \"Inktomi Corporation Formed by UC Berkeley Scientists to Bring Parallel Processing Power to Commercial Internet Applications\".

It was established in 1994 as a university spin-off from Carnegie Mellon University. The name \"Lycos\" is short for \"Lycosidae\", which is the Latin name of wolf spiders.[1] History [edit] This section is in list format but may read better as prose. You can help by converting this section, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (December 2025) Lycos began in May 1994 as a research project by Michael Loren Mauldin of Carnegie Mellon University.[2] Lycos was funded with approximately US$2 million in venture capital funding from CMGI.[3][4] Bob Davis became the CEO and first employee of the new company in 1995.[5] He concentrated on building the company into an advertising-supported web portal, led by Bill Townsend.[6] In April 1996, the company completed the fastest initial public offering from inception to offering in NASDAQ history, ending its first day of trading with a market value of $300 million. It also became the first search engine to become a public company, before rivals Yahoo! and Excite.[7] In May 1997, the company formed Lycos Europe, a joint venture with Bertelsmann.[8] Lycos began offering e-mail services in October 1997.[9] That year, it became one of the first profitable Internet businesses.[10] In February 1998, Lycos acquired Tripod.com for $58 million.[11] In March 1998, Lycos paid $4 million for a 9% stake in GlobeComm, which powered its free email service.[12] In August 1998, Lycos acquired WhoWhere for $133 million in stock.[13] In October 1998, the company acquired the digital assets of Wired for $83 million in stock after the print version of the magazine was sold to Advance Magazine Publishers.[14] The deal also included Hotbot[15] and WebMonkey, which was shut in 2004 but relaunched in 2008.[16] In a brief surge in April 1999, the website was visited by 52% of all internet users, which was more than the reach of Yahoo.[17][18] In 1999, the company abandoned its internal search technology and outsourced search technology to AlltheWeb.[19] In April 1999, Lycos launched an internet radio service.[20] In September 1999, the company acquired Quote.com for $78 million in stock.[21] In November 1999, Lycos acquired Gamesville for $207 million in stock.[22] In December 1999, the company formed Lycos Asia, a $50 million joint venture with Singtel.[23] In June 2000, Lycos acquired Matchmaker.com for $44 million in cash.[24] it was sold in February 2006.[25] In July 2000, Lycos began using Microsoft Windows 2000 software and Intel processors to power its platform.[26] In October 2000, near the peak of the dot-com bubble, Lycos was acquired by Terra Networks, a division of Telefónica, for $12.5 billion and was renamed Terra Lycos.[27] In January 2001, the company acquired RagingBull.com.[28] In October 2002, the company acquired GetRelevant.[29] In October 2004, Terra sold Lycos to Daum Communications Corporation, now Kakao, for $95.4 million in cash, less than 2% of Terra\u0027s initial multibillion-dollar investment.[30] In July 2006, the company sold the digital assets of Wired to Condé Nast Publications which remerged it with the print version of the magazine.[31] In February 2006, Lycos sold Quote.com and RagingBull.com to FT Interactive Data Corporation for $30 million.[32] In March 2006, Lycos introduced phone call services, including video chat, real-time video on demand, and an MP3 player.[33] In November 2006, Lycos introduced Lycos Cinema.[34] In February 2007, Lycos Mix was launched, allowing users to pull video clips from YouTube, Google Video, Yahoo! Video and MySpace Video and allowed users to create playlists where other users could add video comments and chat in real-time.[35] Lycos was sold for $36 million in August 2010 to Ybrant Digital, an Internet marketing company based in Hyderabad, India.[36][37][38] Ybrant Digital paid $20 million at signing and there was a legal dispute over magnitude of the second installment between Ybrant and Daum. In 2018, a New York court ruled in favor of Daum and appointed Daum (by then merged with Kakao) as receiver of Ybrant\u0027s 56% ownership interest in Lycos.[39] In May 2012, Rob Balazy was named CEO.[40] In June 2015, Lycos annou",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Locating information online Online search is the process of interactively searching for and retrieving requested information via a computer from databases that are online.[1] Interactive searches became possible in the 1980s with the advent of faster databases and smart terminals.[1] In contrast, computerized batch searching was prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s.[1] Today, searches through web search engines constitute the majority of online searches. Boolean searches [edit] Most search engines offer advanced search options using Boolean expressions (also known as Boolean operations). These expressions allow searches to produce more precise and meaningful results.[2] Based on Boolean algebra, these types of searches utilize logical operations using binary or dyadic processes. These include AND ( ∧ {\\displaystyle \\land } ) and OR ( ∨ {\\displaystyle \\lor } ) and the unary operator NOT ( ¬ {\\displaystyle \\neg } ).[3] The AND and NOT expressions are known as implied Boolean operators as they require or disallow a word or a phrase.[4] The use of + symbol as a prefix before a keyword requires that word be in a search result. When using multiple Keywords this serves as an AND function requiring that all words with a + sign be in a search result.[2] The use of - symbol as a prefix before a keyword eliminates that word from search results. This is the NOT Boolean operation[2] which is sometimes called a negative search.[5] Searches can not be entirely negative, and must include at least one positive keyword.[4] Some search engines, such as google, utilize systems with an implied AND operation. This means that the search engine will automatically apply the AND function inbetween keywords without having to enter a symbol for the AND operation.[6] Other search engines may require that either the symbol \u0026[7] or +[5] be added as a prefix before the keyword. These search engines use the \"OR\" Boolean expression as a default search setting.[5] Those search engines with a default \"AND\" expression can still do an \"OR\" search by using the | symbol inbetween keywords.[7] References [edit] ^ a b c Hawkins, Donald T.; Brown, Carolyn P.

A figure of merit (FOM) is a performance metric that characterizes the performance of a device, system, or method, relative to its alternatives.[1][2] Examples [edit] Absolute alcohol content per currency unit in an alcoholic beverage Accuracy of a rifle[3] Audio amplifier figures of merit such as gain or efficiency Battery life of a laptop computer[4] Calories per serving Clock rate of a CPU is often given as a figure of merit, but is of limited use in comparing between different architectures. FLOPS may be a better figure, though these too are not completely representative of the performance of a CPU. Contrast ratio of an LCD Frequency response of a speaker Fill factor of a solar cell Resolution of the image sensor in a digital camera Measure of the detection performance of a sonar system, defined as the propagation loss for which a 50% detection probability is achieved Noise figure of a radio receiver The thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, a material constant proportional to the efficiency of a thermoelectric couple made with the material The figure of merit of digital-to-analog converter, calculated as (power dissipation)/(2ENOB × effective bandwidth) [J/Hz] Luminous efficacy of lighting Profit of a company Residual noise remaining after compensation in an aeromagnetic survey Heat absorption and transfer quality for a solar cooker Computational benchmarks are synthetic figures of merit that summarize the speed of algorithms or computers in performing various typical tasks.

See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Founded in 1642 as Ville-Marie, or \"City of Mary\",[14] it now takes its name from Mount Royal,[15] the triple-peaked mountain around which the early settlement was built.[16] The city is centred on the Island of Montreal[17][18] and a few, much smaller, peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It lies 196 kilometres (122 mi) east of the national capital, Ottawa, and 258 kilometres (160 mi) southwest of the provincial capital, Quebec City. As of the 2021 Canadian census[update], the city had a population of 1,762,949, and a metropolitan population of 4,291,732,[7] making it the second-largest metropolitan area in Canada, after Toronto, Ontario. French is the city\u0027s official language.[19][20] In 2021, 85.7% of the population of the city of Montreal considered themselves fluent in French while 90.2% could speak it in the metropolitan area.[21][22] Montreal is one of the most bilingual cities in Quebec and Canada, with 58.5% of the population able to speak both French and English.[23] Montreal is the largest primarily French speaking city in the Americas.

First announced in November 1993[1] by developer Martijn Koster while working at Nexor, and presented in May 1994[2] at the First International Conference on the World Wide Web at CERN in Geneva, ALIWEB preceded WebCrawler by several months.[3] ALIWEB allows users to submit the locations of index files on their sites[3][4] which enables the search engine to include webpages and add user-written page descriptions and keywords. This empowers webmasters to define the terms that would lead users to their pages, and also avoided setting bots (e.g. the Wanderer, JumpStation) which used up bandwidth. Martijn Koster, who was also instrumental in the creation of the Robots Exclusion Standard,[5][6] detailed the background and objectives of ALIWEB with an overview of its functions and framework in the paper he presented at CERN.[2] Koster left Nexor and in the following years development ceased until a new company took over the project. It was discovered that the database file had actually exceeded the range of search so therefore when you entered a search term it would not search the entire database and weight the results, it would only search from the beginning of the database until it either ran out of results to show or exceeded the number of results requested. The new company developers fixed this by weighting the results and searching the entire database before displaying the results.

(June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images.

The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet\u0027s largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet\u0027s internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14] After the success of its original service, Google Search (often known simply as \"Google\"), the company has rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation and mapping (Waze, Maps, and Earth), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android and ChromeOS), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch and Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant and Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Many of these products and services are dominant in their respective industries, as is Google Search. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia),[15] Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[16][17] Google\u0027s other ventures outside of internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Willow), self-driving cars (Waymo), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).[18] Google Search and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide, followed by Facebook, Instagram, and ChatGPT. Google is the largest provider of search engines, mapping and navigation applications, email services, office suites, online video platforms, photo and cloud storage, mobile operating systems, web browsers, machine learning frameworks, and AI virtual assistants in the world as measured by market share.[19] On the list of the most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes as of January 2022,[20] and is fourth by Interbrand as of February 2022.[21] The company has received criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust, and abuse of its monopoly position.[22] History Main articles: History of Google and List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet See also: Alphabet Inc.

(/ˈbaɪduː/ BY-doo; Chinese: 百度; pinyin: Bǎidù; lit. \u0027hundred times\u0027) is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet services and artificial intelligence. It holds a dominant position in China\u0027s search engine market (via Baidu Search), and provides a wide variety of other internet services such as Baidu App (Baidu\u0027s flagship app for search and newsfeed), Baidu Baike (an online user created Wikipedia-like encyclopedia), iQIYI (a video streaming service), and Baidu Tieba (a keyword-based discussion forum similar to Reddit). Besides its core internet search business, Baidu has diversified into several high-growth areas. The company is a player in autonomous driving (Baidu Apollo),[3] and smart consumer electronics (Xiaodu).[4] With over a decade of investment in artificial intelligence, Baidu is one of the few tech companies globally to offer a full-service AI stack, including software, chips, cloud infrastructure, foundation models, and applications.[5] A variable interest entity for Baidu to enable investment of foreign capital is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.[2] Baidu was incorporated in January 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu. Baidu has origins in RankDex, an earlier search engine developed by Robin Li in 1996, before he founded Baidu in 2000.[6] The company is headquartered in Beijing\u0027s Haidian District.[7] In December 2007, Baidu became the first Chinese company to be included in the NASDAQ-100 index.[8] As of May 2018, Baidu\u0027s market cap rose to US$99 billion.[9][10][11] In October 2018, Baidu became the first Chinese firm to join the United States–based computer ethics consortium Partnership on AI.[12] The Chinese government views Baidu as one of its national champion corporations.[13]: 156–157  History [edit] Early development [edit] Baidu headquarters building completed in 2009 In 1994, Robin Li (Pinyin: Li Yanhong, Chinese: 李彦宏) joined IDD Information Services, a New Jersey division of Dow Jones and Company, where he helped develop software for the online edition of The Wall Street Journal.[14] He also worked on developing better algorithms for search engines and remained at IDD Information Services from May 1994 to June 1997. In 1996, while at IDD, Li developed the RankDex site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking[6][15][16] and received a US patent for the technology.[17] Launched in 1996,[6] RankDex was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing.[18] Li referred to his search mechanism as \"link analysis,\" which involved ranking the popularity of a web site based on how many other sites had linked to it.[19] It predated the similar PageRank algorithm used by Google two years later in 1998;[20] Google founder Larry Page referenced Li\u0027s work as a citation in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank.[6][20][21] Li later used his RankDex technology for the Baidu search engine. Baidu was incorporated on 18 January 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu.[7] In 2001, Baidu allowed advertisers to bid for ad space then pay Baidu every time a customer clicked on an ad, predating Google\u0027s approach to advertising.[19] In 2003, Baidu launched a news search engine and picture search engine, adopting a special identification technology capable of identifying and grouping the articles.[22] 2005: Public Listing on NASDAQ [edit] Baidu went public on Wall Street through a variable interest entity (VIE) based in the Cayman Islands on 5 August 2005.[23] In 2007, Chinese government and Chinese industry sources stated that Baidu received a license from Beijing, which allows the search engine to become a full-fle",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Software used to access websites A web browser (Safari) displaying a web page like Wikipedia A web browser, often shortened to browser, is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user\u0027s screen. Browsers can also display content stored locally on the user\u0027s device. Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, smartwatches, smart televisions and consoles.[1] As of 2024[update], the most used browsers worldwide are Google Chrome (~66% market share), Safari (~16%), Edge (~6%), Firefox (~3%), Samsung Internet (~2%), and Opera (~2%).[2][3] As of 2023, an estimated 5.4 billion people had used a browser.[4] Function Navigating to English Wikipedia using a web browser (Firefox) The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content and display it on the user\u0027s device.[5] This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), such as https://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser\u0027s address bar. Virtually all URLs on the Web start with either http: or https: which means they are retrieved with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). For secure mode (HTTPS), the connection between the browser and web server is encrypted, providing a secure and private data transfer.[6] For this reason, a web browser is often referred to as an HTTP client[7][8] or a user agent. Requisite materials, including text, style sheets, images, and other types of multimedia, are downloaded from the server. Once the materials have been downloaded, the web browser\u0027s engine (also known as a layout engine or rendering engine) is responsible for converting those resources into an interactive visual representation of the page on the user\u0027s device.[9] Modern web browsers also contain separate JavaScript engines which enable more complex interactive applications inside the browser.[10] A web browser that does not render a graphical user interface is known as a headless browser. Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is clicked or tapped, the browser navigates to the new resource. Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page. The cache can store many items, such as large images, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again. Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages.[11][12] A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[13][14] A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites and allows users to search for specific resources using a textual query. However, web browsers are often used to access search engines, and most modern browsers allow users to access a default search engine directly by typing a query into the address bar.[15] History Main article: History of the web browser The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.[16][17] He then recruited Nicola Pellow to write the Line Mode Browser, which displayed web pages on dumb terminals.[18] The Mosaic web browser was released in April 1993, and was later credited as the first web browser to find mainstream popularity.[19][20] Its innovative graphical user interface made the World Wide Web easy to navigate and thus more accessible to the average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet boom of the 1990s, when the Web grew at a very rapid rate.[20] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most popular browser.[21] Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. Within a few years, Microsoft gained a dominant position in the browser market for two reasons: it bundled Internet Explorer with its popular Windows operating system and did so as freeware with no restrictions on usage. The market share of Internet Explorer peaked at over 95% in the early 2000s.[22] In 1998, Netscape launched what would become the Mozilla Foundation to create a new browser using the open-source software model. This work evolved into the Firefox browser, first released by Mozilla in 2004. Firefox\u0027s market share peaked at 32% in 2010.[23] Apple released its Safari browser in 2003; it remains the dominant browser on Apple devices, though it did not become popular elsewhere.[24] Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, which steadily took market share from Internet Explorer and became the most popular browser in 2012.[25][26] Chrome has remained dominant ever since.[2] In 2015, Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Edge [Legacy] for the Windows 10 release.[27] In 2020, this legacy version was replac",

    "content": "MSN News Web MSN Images Videos News Maps Search: halalgoogling.com Islam-approved search engine for Muslims, halalgoogling.com. 3 days ago By Michele Laufik of MSN News share tweet email A new search engine targeted for Muslims called Halalgoogling was launched Sunday. It is just like Google — minus nudity and anything else that\u0027s against Islamic law. Islam-approved search engine for Muslims, halalgoogling.com. For many observant Muslims, being able to “Google” something just isn’t an option. Strict Islamic mores can make the Internet a treacherous place, with NSFW content like naked women and sacrilegious stories lurking near every click. Enter Halalgoogling. The new search engine, which launched on Sunday, mimics Google, but blocks sites and content “according to Islamic law,” reports The Express Tribune. Related: Hacking websites in the name of Islam Using an “advanced special filtering system,” explains the Tribune, the site culls information from other major search engines, such as Google and Bing, while blocking results involving pornography, homosexuality, gambling and more. Outlawed words, such as “nude,” return this message: No results found or you have searched Haram (forbidden) content. According to Halalgoogling’s blog, “haram” is an Arabic term referring to every deed or act that violates Allah’s rules. The term “halal’’ is the opposite and applies to anything permitted or lawful in Islam. Halalgoogling doesn’t feature an image search option — yet — but it does offer a shopping tab, along with sports and news. Related: Scary but true — kids are acting like adults on the Internet With 1.5 billion Muslims around the world, the search engine was created to “satisfy the Internet needs of the Muslim community, so each Muslim can surf the web in the Halal way,” according to the project\u0027s mission statement. But the site isn’t foolproof. The beta site and its creators issued a preventive mea culpa in case a user encounters any haram content that may have slipped through the cracks: “We apologize for any unintentional mistake that we might have made or could make in the future.” Users are encouraged to report any inappropriate content that is “contrary to the principles of Islam or content you think it should be excluded from the Haram filtering system.” —— Join MSN News on social Share your point of view with us on Facebook Get the latest news and updates on Twitter See photos and videos on tumblr AdChoices Ad Feedback 5 things to know today 5 to Know: July 11 Mom gets message in a bottle from dead daughter \u0026 more 5 to Watch: Dramatic mudslide in the Rocky Mountains \u0026 more most popular Rare footage shows FDR in wheelchair Randy Travis recovering from brain surgery Country star Randy Travis suffered a stroke while being treated for congestive heart failure provoked by a viral illness and had surgery Wednesday evening.

Treating search engines as editorial products with intrinsic biases can help understand the structure of information flows in new media. This paper outlines an empirical methodology to analyze the representation of topics in search engines, reducing the spatial and temporal biases in the results. As a case study, the methodology is applied to 15 popular conspiracy theories, examining type of content and ideological bias, demonstrating how this approach can inform debates in this field, specifically in relation to the representation of non-mainstream positions, the suppression of controversies and relativism.

The use of paid inclusion is controversial, and paid inclusion\u0027s popularity has decreased over time among search engines. Definition of paid inclusion [edit] The FTC defined paid inclusion as \"Paid inclusion can take many forms. Examples of paid inclusion include programs where the only sites listed are those that have paid; where paid sites are intermingled among non-paid sites; and where companies pay to have their Websites or URLs reviewed more quickly, or for more frequent spidering of their Websites or URLs, or for the review or inclusion of deeper levels of their Websites, than is the case with non-paid sites.\"[1] Note that paid inclusion is different from paid placement. With paid placement, companies pay search engines to rank higher than they would have ranked if relevancy was the only ranking factor. Paid placement also gives companies guaranteed top rankings if they pay for it.[2] With paid inclusion, top rankings are not guaranteed, and only inclusion within the search engine is. Therefore, a company who paid for inclusion within a search engine will still have its rankings determined by relevancy.[3] History of paid inclusion [edit] In the early days of search, paid inclusion was a convenient way for search engines, such as Inktomi, Microsoft, Ask, Yahoo, Overture, AltaVista, and FAST, to obtain revenue.[3][4] Unlike the other major search engines, Google decided to avoid paid inclusion and, instead, pursue higher relevancy using AdSense as its revenue source. As time went by, search engines such as Microsoft and Ask moved away from paid inclusion—both search engines ended paid inclusion programs in 2004.[5] Google\u0027s incorporation of paid inclusion [edit] In 2012, Google re-incorporated paid inclusion within its search, though in a different form. Google Flights, Google Hotel Finder, and Google Shopping all have new forms of paid inclusion programs. Some critics, such as Danny Sullivan, founder of Search Engine Watch, criticize this move as a step away from the Founder\u0027s Letter that was a part of Google\u0027s IPO.[6] Aaron Wall of the popular SEO site SEOBook.com criticize Google\u0027s use of paid inclusion as a way to push almost all organic rankings below the fold.[7] Mixed views on paid inclusion [edit] Paid inclusion has its advantages and drawbacks. The advantage of a paid inclusion search engine is that spam is reduced while relevancy improves.[8] However, detractors of paid inclusion allege that it causes searches to return results based more on the economic standing of the interests of a web site, and less on the relevancy of that site to end-users.[4] Ask Jeeves reported that paid inclusion reduced relevancy and, in 2004, ended its paid inclusion program.[9] Guidelines for paid inclusion [edit] The FTC has advised search engines to clearly mark paid placement and paid inclusion in accordance with Section 5 of the FTC Act.[10] For this is only a guideline and not a law, companies with search algorithms such as Nextag and Google are not legally bound to follow it.[11][12][13] See also [edit] Search engine optimization Favored placement Instant indexing References [edit] ^ \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20580\".

Gemini (2014–2017) Company type subsidiary Industry Internet Founded 1997; 28 years ago (1997) Headquarters Sunnyvale, California , U.S. Parent Yahoo! Website gemini.yahoo.com YahooSearchAd Yahoo! Native (formerly known as Yahoo! Advertising, Yahoo! Search Marketing and Yahoo! Gemini) is a native \"Pay per click\" Internet advertising service provided by Yahoo. Yahoo began offering this service after acquiring Overture Services, Inc. The current offering of Yahoo Native launched in 2014 as Yahoo! Gemini. It handles advertising for both Yahoo and AOL properties, as well as other media outlets. History [edit] GoTo and Overture [edit] GoTo main page in 1998 GoTo (not to be confused with Go.com or Go2Net) was an Idealab spin off and was the first company to successfully provide a pay-for-placement search service.[1][2][3] It started off with the purchase of World Wide Web Worm (WWWW), one of the oldest search engines.[4] GoTo is considered to have been an influential pioneer of paid search.[5][6] In February 1998, GoTo offered advertisers the option of bidding on how much they would be willing to pay to appear at the top of results in response to specific searches. The bid amount was paid by the advertiser to GoTo every time a searcher clicked on a link to the advertiser\u0027s website. By July 1998, advertisers were paying anything up to a dollar per click. In June 1999, GoTo launched a tool set direct traffic centre (dtc) to enable advertisers access to keywords and real time bidding. GoTo\u0027s business model was based on the idea that its paid listings would make it more relevant than other services, especially for general searches, and web sites that pay more are probably better sites. A similar service had been offered by Open Text in 1996, but this precipitated outcries and bad publicity because searchers at the time did not want the search process more commercialized. In contrast, GoTo\u0027s pay-for-placement model was very successful. Commenters theorized that the Internet had matured in the intervening two years, and this type of economic models were more acceptable since the web was no longer just a place for academic research, but also a place for buying products. GoTo founder Bill Gross speculated at the launch that GoTo would succeed because, as a relatively new service, it had no reputation to taint with paid listings, unlike Open Text. On October 8, 2001, GoTo renamed itself Overture Services, Inc.[7] GoTo\u0027s chief operating officer Jaynie Studenmund, mother of fallen U.S. soldier Scott Studenmund,[8] said, \"We also felt it was a sophisticated enough name, in case our products expand.\" Through partnerships, Overture enabled portals such as MSN and Yahoo to monetize the hundreds of millions of web searches made each day on their sites. Indeed, these partnerships proved highly lucrative, and in a period otherwise marked by dot-com failures, Overture became a substantial profit driver for portals like Yahoo[9] This success enabled Overture to acquire web sites such as AltaVista and AlltheWeb.[10] Acquisition of Overture by Yahoo! [edit] On October 7, 2003, Overture was acquired by its biggest customer, Yahoo!, for $1.63 billion.[11][10] The old brand name of Overture was phased out as Yahoo rebranded many of its products under the Yahoo name. The exception to this was in Japan and Korea where the local businesses continued to use the Overture brand. Panama [edit] Panama was an online advertising platform created by Yahoo!, launched on 5 February 2007.[12] Panama was Yahoo\u0027s effort to close the wide gap with Google in the race for search advertising dollars, a fast-growing business then dominated by Google, which is now also dominated by Google. Customers with accounts already on Yahoo! were transferred to the new system over the following few months. Yahoo! inherited the search advertising business when it purchased Overture (previously named Goto.com). Until Panama, Yahoo! search continued to operate the original simplistic algorithm which ranked text ads according to how much advertisers bid for the keyword searched by the user. Meanwhile, Google operates under a more sophisticated model, which ranks paid ads on the basis of bid price as well as prior click-through rates. This improvement generally produces higher click through rates (hence higher revenues) for the search engine.[citation needed] This also allowed Yahoo to control the pricing of ad auctions rather than having the auctions operate at market value. For example, an ambulance-chasing attorney bidding for the keywords \"back pain\" would likely get a lower clickthrough rate than the keyword \"physiotherapist\", regardless of what the two parties bid per click. An algorithm that eventually de-prioritizes the ",

Volunia, dubbed as \"the search engine of the future\",[7] was speculated to be based on Hyper Search technology.[8][9] On June 8, 2012, Marchiori announced with an open letter[10] that he had been excluded from his project:[11] six days later, on June 14, 2012, the site went live, but it ceased to operate in February 2014. History [edit] The front page of Volunia, in March 2012. The name Volunia stems from the words \"volo\" (flight) and \"luna\" (moon), because – as Marchiori said – he wanted to evoke the quantum leap his social search engine was trying to deliver.[1] The Volunia project was entirely developed in Italy: the head office was located in Padua, the servers were located in Sardinia and hosted by Tiscali,[1] and the whole team, formed by 14 people, was Italian.[citation needed] The project [edit] Volunia differed from normal search engines in that, while it crawled the web and indexed websites, it built the ranking using the comments and opinions of other users. The Volunia service allowed people to interact with each other in every page they visit,[12] as well as with the web sites\u0027 owners. Volunia used a system similar to Sidewiki. Volunia also introduced for the first time a \"fly-over\" map visualization for every web site, where every web site was turned into a city metaphor, also representing social information.[13][14] According to Marchiori, Volunia was not meant to be a competitor to the existing search engines, staying on an alternative level.[7] Despite what Marchiori had said, some people in the internet community considered Volunia a challenge and a potential competitor for Google.[1][15] References [edit] ^ a b c d Caprara, Giovanni (7 February 2012). \"Volunia, Italy\u0027s Answer to Google\".

Neeva had raised $77.5m from investors.[4] In 2023, the co-founders announced the shutdown of the search engine on June 2.[5] According to them, the main reason for that decision was how hard it was to persuade normal users to make the switch. They thanked customers and announced that they would be compensating users for the unused portion of Neeva accounts and reallocating their tools and technologies to other industries.[6] In May 2023, Snowflake announced the acquisition of Neeva, for $185.4M in cash.[7] This was to accelerate the search in the Cloud through Artificial Intelligence.[8] Following the acquisition, Neeva co-founder Sridhar Ramaswamy later became the CEO of Snowflake. Features [edit] Search results [edit] Neeva\u0027s search results were a compilation of various partners including Yelp, Ignite, Intrinio, Microsoft Bing, and its own Web crawler.[2] It included weather information from The Weather Channel[3] and maps data from Apple Inc.[3] Neeva also allowed customers to link personal items which could then be searched.[9] See also [edit] Comparison of web search engines References [edit] ^ \"Neeva\".

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \"GUI\" redirects here. For other uses, see GUI (disambiguation). A graphical user interface (GUI) showing various elements: radio buttons, checkboxes, and other elements. The image shown uses the KDE desktop environment. A graphical user interface, or GUI[a], is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation. In many applications, GUIs are used instead of text-based UIs, which are based on typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs),[4][5][6] which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard. The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.[7][8][9] Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls. The term GUI tends not to be applied to other lower-display resolution types of interfaces, such as video games (where head-up displays (HUDs)[10] are preferred), or not including flat screens like volumetric displays[11] because the term is restricted to the scope of 2D display screens able to describe generic information, in the tradition of the computer science research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. GUI and interaction design [edit] The GUI is presented (displayed) on the computer screen. It is the result of processed user input and usually the main interface for human-machine interaction. The touch UIs popular on small mobile devices are an overlay of the visual output to the visual input. Designing the visual composition and temporal behavior of a GUI is an important part of software application programming in the area of human–computer interaction. Its goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the underlying logical design of a stored program, a design discipline named usability. Methods of user-centered design are used to ensure that the visual language introduced in the design is well-tailored to the tasks. The visible graphical interface features of an application are sometimes referred to as chrome or GUI.[12][13][14] Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual widgets that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold. The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A model–view–controller allows flexible structures in which the interface is independent of and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different skin or theme at will, and eases the designer\u0027s work to change the interface as user needs evolve. Good GUI design relates to users more, and to system architecture less. Large widgets, such as windows, usually provide a frame or container for the main presentation content such as a web page, email message, or drawing. Smaller ones usually act as a user-input tool. A GUI may be designed for the requirements of a vertical market as application-specific GUIs. Examples include automated teller machines (ATM), point of sale (POS) touchscreens at restaurants,[15] self-service checkouts used in a retail store, airline self-ticket and check-in, information kiosks in a public space, like a train station or a museum, and monitors or control screens in an embedded industrial application which employ a real-time operating system (RTOS). Cell phones and handheld game systems also employ application specific touchscreen GUIs. Newer automobiles use GUIs in their navigation systems and multimedia centers, or navigation multimedia center combinations.

A series of elements conforming a visual language have evolved to represent information stored in computers. This makes it easier for people with few computer skills to work with and use computer software. The most common combination of such elements in GUIs is the windows, icons, text fields, canvases, menus, pointer (WIMP) paradigm, especially in personal computers.[16] The WIMP style of interaction uses a virtual input device to represent the position of a pointing device\u0027s interface, most often a mouse, and presents information organize",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia System with multiple networked computers Not to be confused with Decentralized computing. Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems, defined as computer systems whose inter-communicating components are located on different networked computers.[1][2] The components of a distributed system communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three challenges of distributed systems are: maintaining concurrency of components, overcoming the lack of a global clock, and managing the independent failure of components.[1] When a component of one system fails, the entire system does not fail.[3] Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to microservices to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications. Distributed systems cost more than monolithic architectures, primarily due to increased needs for additional hardware, servers, gateways, firewalls, new subnets, proxies, and so on.[4] Distributed systems can also suffer from fallacies of distributed computing. Conversely, a well-designed distributed system is more scalable, more durable, more changeable, and more fine-tuned than a monolithic application deployed on a single machine.[5] According to Marc Brooker: \"a system is scalable in the range where marginal cost of additional workload is nearly constant.\" Serverless technologies fit this definition but the total cost of ownership, and not just the infra cost must be considered.[6] A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program,[7] and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs.[8] There are many types of implementations for the message-passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors, and message queues.[9] Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers,[10] which communicate with each other via message passing.[11] Introduction [edit] The word distributed in terms such as \"distributed system\", \"distributed programming\", and \"distributed algorithm\" originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area.[12] The terms are nowadays used in a much wider sense, even referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing.[11] There is no single definition of a distributed system,[13] but two common properties are generally cited: There are several autonomous computational entities (computers or nodes), each of which has its own local memory.[14] The entities communicate with each other by message passing.[15] A distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational problem;[16] the user then perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit. Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or provide communication services to the users.[17] Other typical properties of distributed systems are: The system must tolerate failures in individual computers.[18] The structure of the system (network topology, network latency, number of computers) is not known in advance. The system may consist of different kinds of computers and network links. The system may change during the execution of a distributed program.[19] Each computer has a limited, incomplete view of the system. Each computer may know only one part of the input.[20] Patterns [edit] Here are common architectural patterns used for distributed computing:[21] Saga interaction pattern Microservices Event driven architecture Events vs. Messages [edit] In distributed systems, events represent a fact or state change (e.g., OrderPlaced) and are typically broadcast asynchronously to multiple consumers, promoting loose coupling and scalability. While events generally don\u0027t expect an immediate response, acknowledgment mechanisms are often implemented at the infrastructure level (e.g., Kafka commit offsets, SNS delivery statuses) rather than being an inherent part of the event pattern itself.[22][23] In contrast, messages serve a broader role, encompassing commands (e.g., ProcessPayment), events (e.g., PaymentProcessed), and documents (e.g., DataPayload). Both events and messages can support various delivery guarantees, including at-least-once, at-most-once, and exactly-once, depending on the technology stack and implementation. However, exactly-once delivery is often achieved through idempotency mechanisms rather than true, infrastructure-level exactly-once semantics.[22][23] Delivery patterns for both events and messages include publish/subscribe (one-to-many) and point-t",

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2025) Presearch Type of site Web search engine URL presearch.com Registration Optional Launched 2017; 8 years ago (2017) Presearch is a decentralized, privacy-focused metasearch engine. Launched in 2017, it is developed by Presearch.org, originally a Canadian-based organization. The platform enables users to query search engines through a distributed network operated by independent node operators, which keeps user data and searches private.[1][2] Features [edit] Presearch offers a customizable interface that allows users to access multiple search providers, including Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, offering an private search option, even through other search engines.[3] The platform includes a keyword staking system where users can allocate PRE tokens to promote websites in search results. In late 2024, the project introduced a search ad format called \"Takeover Advertising,\" and in early 2025 it launched \"Spicy Mode,\" an optional feature for filtering adult content. Privacy and architecture [edit] Presearch’s architecture uses a decentralized network of community-operated nodes to process search queries. According to project documentation, the platform is designed to reduce centralized data collection and does not store users’ IP addresses or search histories. It also implements techniques to limit browser fingerprinting.[4][5] Independent search index and Frontier Intelligence [edit] Frontier Intelligence is a feature of Presearch designed to provide users with access to a broader range of content that may be overlooked or suppressed by traditional search engines. The initiative focuses on indexing human-first content, prioritizing relevance over commercial interests. Unlike commercial search engines that are influenced by advertising and corporate agendas, Frontier Intelligence aims to offer a more diverse and decentralized search experience. Central to this initiative is Presearch’s independent search index, which operates through a decentralized network of community-run nodes. This infrastructure allows for the indexing of niche, controversial, or non-commercial content that is often excluded from mainstream search results. The independent search index is built to surface this underrepresented content, ensuring users have access to a wider variety of perspectives. Presearch\u0027s results system operates without tracking or profiling users, providing search results based purely on content relevance.[6][7] NSFW Spicy Mode [edit] Launched in 2025, Spicy Mode is a privacy-focused feature on Presearch that allows users to discover adult content creators in a private environment. The mode uses the Presearch privacy architecture to keep searches and data private, while allowing users to search directly for adult content creators. Users can search for creators based on specific interests, including filtering by subscription price, region, likes, and free trial status.[8][9][10] In addition to providing a safe and private browsing experience, Spicy Mode also offers an avenue for adult creators, services, and products to advertise within ethical guidelines. The feature includes non-intrusive wallpaper-style takeover ads, allowing adult brands to connect with their audience without the stigma or restrictions commonly found on mainstream platforms. Token system [edit] The platform uses PRE, an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum and Base blockchains. Registered users may earn tokens by running nodes or performing searches. Tokens can also be used to stake on keywords in the platform’s ad system. Node network [edit] The Presearch network includes tens of thousands of independently operated nodes that route search traffic. As of 2025, the software stack is partially open-source. A 2021 academic review of decentralized search engines noted that Presearch’s use of community nodes offers potential for scalability and privacy, but may face limitations compared to centralized systems in indexing and query speed.[11] Governance and development [edit] The project is maintained by a core development team with input from its broader community. The developers have outlined plans to decentralize governance and increase transparency through open-sourcing more of the platform. In 2025, Presearch launched a WeFunder campaign to raise $1.2 million to accelerate the rollout of a decentralized web index and enhance various platform features.[12] Reception [edit] In 2021, Google added Presearch as a default search engine option on Android devices in the European Union, following antitrust rulings regarding search engine choice.[13] The service has been featured in industry publications and included in PCMag’s list of alternative search engines focused on privacy.[14] A 2023 privacy-focused review by NicFab described Presearch as",

He is the co-founder and former CEO of Yahoo! Inc. and founding partner of AME Cloud Ventures.[1][2] As of May 2025,[update] Yang has a net worth of $3.1 billion.[3] Early life and education [edit] Yang was born Yang Chih-Yuan in Taipei, Taiwan, on November 6, 1968.[2] His mother was a professor of English and drama and his father died when he was two. Yang has a younger brother, Chih-Kong Ken Yang.[4][5] In 1978, his mother moved the family to San Jose, California, where his grandmother and extended family took care of the boys while his mother taught English to other immigrants.[4][6][7] After moving to the US, Yang took the American name Jerry; his mother, Lily; and his younger brother, Ken.[8] He says that he only knew one English word, \"shoe\", when he came to America, but became fluent in English in about three years.[9] During his time at San Jose, Yang attended Ruskin Elementary School, Sierramont Middle, and Piedmont Hills High School. He graduated from Piedmont Hills High School and went on to earn both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in electrical engineering from Stanford University in four years.[9] He met David Filo at Stanford in 1989, and the two went to Japan in 1992 for a six-month exchange program, where he met his future wife, Akiko Yamazaki, also participating in the exchange program.[9] Career [edit] Yang founded Yahoo! in 1994 and was CEO from 2007 to 2009. He left Yahoo! in 2012. He founded a venture capital firm called AME Cloud Ventures and, as of 2015, is on several corporate boards. According to Rob Solomon, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners, Yang was \"a great founder, evangelist, strategist and mentor,\" having \"created the blueprint for what is possible on the Internet.\"[10] 1994–2012: Yahoo! years [edit] While studying at Stanford in 1994, Yang and David Filo co-created an Internet website called \"Jerry and David\u0027s Guide to the World Wide Web,\" which consisted of a directory of other websites. As it grew in popularity they renamed it \"Yahoo! Inc.\" Yahoo! received around 100,000 unique visitors by the fall of 1994. In April 1995, Yahoo! received a $2 million investment from Sequoia Capital, Tim Koogle was hired as CEO, and Yang and Filo were each appointed \"Chief Yahoo.\" Yahoo! received a second round of funding in the Fall of 1995 from Reuters and Softbank. It went public in April 1996 with 49 employees.[4][11][12] In 1999, Yang was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[3][13] Terry Semel, who replaced Tim Koogle as CEO after the dot-com bubble crash, was CEO until 2007 when the rise of Google led the board to fire him and appoint Yang as interim CEO.[4] Alibaba [edit] Yang met Alibaba founder Jack Ma in 1997 during Yang\u0027s first trip to China. Ma, a government-employed tour guide and former English teacher, gave Yang a tour of the Great Wall of China. The two hit it off and discussed the growth of the Web. Ma created Alibaba several months later. A 1997 photo of Yang and Ma at the Great Wall still hangs on the wall in Alibaba\u0027s Hangzhou office.[4] In 2005, under Yang\u0027s direction but before he took over as CEO in 2007, Yahoo! purchased a 40% stake in Alibaba for $1 billion plus the assets of Yahoo! China, valued at $700 million.[4] In 2012, Yahoo! sold a portion of its stake in Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[14] The company made an additional $9.4 billion in Alibaba\u0027s 2014 IPO.[15] Eric Jackson, the founder of hedge fund Ironfire Capital, called Yahoo!\u0027s investment in Alibaba \"the best investment an American company has ever made in China,\" and stated, \"Jerry deserves enormous credit for that.\"[14] Chinese government controversies [edit] In the fall 2005, a month after the Alibaba investment, news broke that Yahoo! had cooperated with Chinese authorities in the arrest of Chinese journalist Shi Tao in November 2004.[16] Shi had used a Yahoo email address to anonymously notify a pro-democracy website in the US that the Chinese government had ordered the Chinese media not to cover the fifteenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 on June 4.

See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Types of social media involved include RSS feeds, blogging sites, social bookmarking sites, social news websites, video sharing websites such as YouTube and social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (Twitter). SMO is similar to search engine optimization (SEO) in that the goal is to drive web traffic, and draw attention to a company or creator. SMO\u0027s focal point is on gaining organic links to social media content. In contrast, SEO\u0027s core is about reaching the top of the search engine hierarchy.[1] In general, social media optimization refers to optimizing a website and its content to encourage more users to use and share links to the website across social media and networking sites.[2] SMO is used to strategically create online content ranging from well-written text to eye-catching digital photos or video clips that encourages and entices people to engage with a website. Users share this content, via its weblink, with social media contacts and friends. Common examples of social media engagement are \"liking and commenting on posts, retweeting, embedding, sharing, and promoting content\".[3] Social media optimization is also an effective way of implementing online reputation management (ORM), meaning that if someone posts bad reviews of a business, an SMO strategy can ensure that the negative feedback is not the first link to come up in a list of search engine results.[4] In the 2010s, with social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people, news organizations have become increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating web traffic. Publishers such as The Economist employ large social media teams to optimize their online posts and maximize traffic,[5] while other major publishers now use advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology to generate higher volumes of web traffic.[6] Relationship with search engine optimization The flow and proliferation of content and link shares via social media lead to greater search engine optimization. Social media optimization is an increasingly important factor in search engine optimization, which is the process of designing a website in a way so that it has as high a ranking as possible on search engines. Search engines are increasingly utilizing the recommendations of users of social networks such as Reddit, Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Instagram to rank pages in the search engine result pages.[7] The implication is that when a webpage is shared or \"liked\" by a user on a social network, it counts as a \"vote\" for that webpage\u0027s quality. Thus, search engines can use such votes accordingly to properly ranked websites in search engine results pages. Furthermore, since it is more difficult to tip the scales or influence the search engines in this way, search engines are putting more stock into social search.[7] This, coupled with increasingly personalized search based on interests and location, has significantly increased the importance of a social media presence in search engine optimization. Due to personalized search results, location-based social media presences on websites such as Yelp, Google Places, Foursquare, and Yahoo! Local have become increasingly important. While social media optimization is related to search engine marketing, it differs in several ways. Primarily, SMO focuses on driving web traffic from sources other than search engines, though improved search engine ranking is also a benefit of successful social media optimization. Further, SMO is helpful to target particular geographic regions in order to target and reach potential customers. This helps in lead generation (finding new customers) and contributes to high conversion rates (i.e., converting previously uninterested individuals into people who are interested in a brand or organization). Relationship with viral marketing Social media optimization is in many ways connected to the technique of viral marketing or \"viral seeding\" where word of mouth is created through the use of networking in social bookmarking, video and photo sharing websites.

Founded in 1996 by Ivo Lukačovič in Prague as the first web portal in the Czech Republic. Seznam started with a search engine and an internet version of yellow pages. Today, Seznam runs almost 30 different web services and associated brands. Seznam had more than 6 million real users per month at the end of 2014.[4] Among the most popular services, according to NetMonitor, are its homepage seznam.cz, email.cz, search.seznam.cz and its yellow pages firmy.cz.[citation needed] In 2008, Seznam.cz was the most used search engine in the Czech Republic.[5] As of May 2012, according to Toplist results, Seznam was the second internet search engine in the Czech Republic (42.84%) with Google in the top spot (54.69%).[citation needed]. By August 2014, still according to Toplist\u0027s statistics, Seznam\u0027s share of searches had further eroded to 38%. Between 2011 and 2012, Seznam Czech rhyme; Seznam - najdu tam, co hledám (Seznam - I find there, what I search for) as its slogan. Its former (\u0026 current) slogan is Seznam - najdu tam, co neznám (Seznam - I find there, what I don\u0027t know).[6] History [edit] Founded by Ivo Lukačovič in 1996, Seznam began as the first internet yellow pages and search engine in the Czech Republic. Ivo started his business with 50,000 CZK he had saved up. In 1998, Seznam added email to its portfolio, with email accounts running on the @seznam.cz domain. Since then, more brands and services have come on-line. Since 2001, Seznam has included financial, social and political news, TV programs, weather forecasts, dictionaries, maps and community services.[citation needed] In 2000, Spray International, a Swedish web portal company, invested in Seznam. At that time Seznam became a joint stock company. Until 2000, Ivo Lukačovič was self-employed and Seznam was his own sole business. With the investment, it is estimated that Spray International acquired around 30% share of Seznam. Exact numbers are not known, as Lukačovič and Seznam officials have never released any details about the transaction.[citation needed] What has been confirmed, though, is that Ivo Lukačovič retained at least 70% of Seznam stock after the investment.[7] Spray acquired a stake in Seznam with the intention of making an IPO; however, Spray never reached that goal. After the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Spray abandoned the idea. There are rumors about Spray defaulting on its obligations to Ivo Lukačovič by not making an IPO.[8] In 2003, Ivo Lukačovič increased the base capital of Seznam without Spray and became 70% owner of Seznam. Since 2003, Ivo Lukačovič has remained the controlling shareholder of Seznam.[citation needed] Until 2003, Seznam had been using a fulltext engine from the Czech company Jyxo; however, in 2005, Seznam replaced that search engine with its own technology. Also in 2005, Seznam acquired the Czech firm ATC which was, among other ventures, running the email server Email.cz. Email services Email.cz and Seznam.cz have now merged.[9] In 2006, Seznam moved its headquarters from Prague Košíře to a more prominent location in the Prague Anděl. That year, Ivo Lukačovič gave up the day-to-day business direction of Seznam, and Pavel Zima became CEO. In the Fall of 2006, Seznam acquired all email users from another web portal, \"Czech On Line\", with the domain @post.cz.[10] Seznam bought 50% of Global Inspiration, a Czech company running a video portal Stream.cz, similar to the global YouTube in 2007. Lycos Europe (a subsequent incarnation of Spray International) sold its 30% share in Seznam to Tiger Holding and Miura International. Lycos received more than 1.7 billion CZK from this transaction.[11] As of 2015, Miura International S.a.r.l. had 5,6% of shares, Tiger holding four S.a.r.l. had 24,4% of shares and Helifreak limited had 70% of shares.[12] In 2008, the Czech media reported on alleged meetings between Seznam and Goldman Sachs representatives to find a buyer for Se",

As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO involves understanding how search engines operate, the algorithms that shape their results, the information users seek, the keywords and queries they enter, and the specific search engines favored by the intended audience. SEO helps websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher within a search engine results page (SERP), aiming to either convert the visitors or build brand awareness.[5] History Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Search engine users would query the URL of a page, and then receive information found on the page, if it existed in the search engine\u0027s index. ALIWEB and the earliest versions of search engines required website developers to manually upload website index files in order to be searchable and widely did not utilize any form of ranking algorithm for user queries.[6] The emergence of automated web crawlers would later be used to proactively discover and index websites. This led to website developers to optimize their website’s search signals, including the use of meta tags, to achieve greater visibility in search results. According to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current Google employee Danny Sullivan, the phrase \"search engine optimization\" came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits SEO practitioner Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.[7] In some cases, early search algorithms weighted particular HTML attributes in ways that could be leveraged by web content providers to manipulate their search rankings.[8] As early as 1997, search engine providers began adjusting their algorithms to prevent these actions.[9] Eventually, search engines would incorporate more meaningful measures of page purpose, including the more recent development of semantic search.[10] Some search engines frequently sponsor SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization.[11][12] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website.[13] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the \"crawl rate\", and track the web pages index status. In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products, resulting in brands and marketers shifting toward mobile-first experiences.[14] In the 2020s, the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini gave rise to discussion around a concept variously referred to as generative engine optimization, answer engine optimization or artificial intelligence optimization. This approach focuses on optimizing content for inclusion in AI-generated answers provided by large language models (LLMs). This shift has led digital marketers to discuss content formats, authority signals, and how structured data is presented to make content mor",

Servers similar to this one are often used as web servers. Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website. Server farm with thousands of web servers used for super-high traffic websites ADSL modem running an embedded web server serving dynamic web pages used for modem configuration A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1][2][3][4][5] The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.[6] A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications. Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages. History [edit] First web proposal (1989) evaluated as \"vague but exciting...\" The world\u0027s first web server, a NeXT Computer workstation with Ethernet, 1990. The case label reads: \"This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!\" See also: History of the web browser, History of the World Wide Web, and History of the Internet This is a very brief history of web server programs, so some information necessarily overlaps with the histories of the web browsers, the World Wide Web and the Internet; therefore, for the sake of clarity and understandability, some key historical information below reported may be similar to that found also in one or more of the above-mentioned history articles.[7] Initial WWW project (1989–1991) [edit] In March 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system. The proposal titled \"HyperText and CERN\", asked for comments and it was read by several people. In October 1990 the proposal was reformulated and enriched (having as co-author Robert Cailliau), and finally, it was approved.[8][9][10] Between late 1990 and early 1991 the project resulted in Berners-Lee and his developers writing and testing several software libraries along with three programs, which initially ran on NeXTSTEP OS installed on NeXT workstations:[11][12][10] a graphical web browser, called WorldWideWeb; a portable line mode web browser; a web server, later known as CERN httpd. Those early browsers retrieved web pages written in a simple early form of HTML from web servers using a new basic communication protocol that was named HTTP 0.9. In August 1991 Tim Berners-Lee announced the birth of WWW technology and encouraged scientists to adopt and develop it.[13] Soon after, those programs, along with their source code, were made available to people interested in their usage.[11] Although the source code was not formally licensed or placed in the public domain, CERN informally allowed users and developers to experiment and further develop on top of them. Berners-Lee started promoting the adoption and the usage of those programs along with their porting to other operating systems.[10] Fast and wild development (1991–1995) [edit] In December 1991, the first web server outside Europe was installed at SLAC (U.S.A.).[12] This was a very important event because it started trans-continental web communications between web browsers and web servers.

Filter bubbles are seen as critical enablers of Brexit, Trump, Bolsonaro, and other populist political phenomena, and search and social media companies have been criticised for failing to prevent their development. Yet, there is scant empirical evidence for their existence, or for the related concept of \u0027echo chambers\u0027: indeed, search and social media users generally appear to encounter a highly centrist media diet that is, if anything, more diverse than that of non-users. However, the persistent use of these concepts in mainstream media and political debates has now created its own discursive reality that continues to impact materially on societal institutions, media and communication platforms, and ordinary users themselves. This article provides a critical review of the \u0027filter bubble\u0027 idea, and concludes that its persistence has served only to redirect scholarly attention from far more critical areas of enquiry.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Doi (identifier)) ISO standard unique string identifier for a digital object This article is about a persistent identifier. For the use of digital object identifiers on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Digital Object Identifier. For other uses, see Doi (disambiguation). Digital object identifier Full name Digital Object Identifier Acronym DOI Organisation International DOI Foundation Introduced October 1997; 28 years ago (1997-10)[1] Example 10.1000/182 Website www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/ A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify various objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[2] DOIs are an implementation of the Handle System;[3][4] they also fit within the URI system (Uniform Resource Identifier). They are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. A DOI aims to resolve to its target, the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL where the object is located. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from ISBNs or ISRCs which are identifiers only. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model to represent metadata. The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI should provide a more stable link than directly using its URL. But if its URL changes, the publisher must update the metadata for the DOI to maintain the link to the URL.[5][6][7] It is the publisher\u0027s responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link, leaving the DOI useless.[8] The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000.[9] Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs.[10] The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF.[11] The cumulative number of DOIs has increased exponentially over time, from 50 million registrations in 2011 to 391 million in 2025.[12] The rate of registering organizations (\"members\") has also increased over time from 4,000 in 2011 to 9,500 in 2013, but the federated nature of the system means it is not immediately clear how many members there are in total today.[13] Fake registries have even appeared.[14] Nomenclature and syntax [edit] A DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash. prefix/suffix\n The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is a number greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.[15][16] The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.[17] For example, in the DOI name 10.1000/182, the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182. The \"10\" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,[A] and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. 182 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the DOI Handbook). DOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, performances, and abstract works[18] such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc. The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model. Display [edit] The official DOI Handbook explicitly states that DOIs should be displayed on screens and in print in the format doi:10.1000/182.[19] Contrary to the DOI Handbook, Crossref, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) instead of the officially specified format.[20][21] The DOI Foundation guarantees these URLs to be persistent[22] i.e. such URLs are PURLs — providing the location of a name resolv",

See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Vannevar Bush envisioned libraries of research with connected annotations, which are similar to modern hyperlinks.[4] Link analysis eventually became a crucial component of search engines through algorithms such as Hyper ",

He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4] Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989[5][6] and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.[7][8][9][10][11] He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web\u0027s subsequent development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In 2009, he was elected Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.[12][13] Berners-Lee was previously a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder\u0027s chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[14] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)[15] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[16][17] In 2011, he was named a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[18] He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is an advisor at social network MeWe.[19] In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[20][21] He received the 2016 Turing Award \"for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale\".[22] He was named in Time magazine\u0027s list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.[23] Early life Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955,[24] the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Berners-Lee (née Woods; 1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management. Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973.[1][20] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[25] In 1976, Berners-Lee took a first in physics from The Queen\u0027s College, Oxford.[1][24] While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.[26] Career and research Berners-Lee, 2005 After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset.[24] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.[24] Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.[27] To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.[28] After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole\u0027s Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.[29] He ran the company\u0027s technical side for three years.[30] The project he worked on was a \"real-time remote procedure call\" which gave him experience in computer networking.[29] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.[28] In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet: I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web. — Tim Berners-Lee[31] Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working a",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Intellectual isolation through internet algorithms \"Social media bubble\" redirects here. For the technology boom and bust phenomenon, see Social media stock bubble. Social media inadvertently isolates users into their own ideological filter bubbles, according to internet activist Eli Pariser. A filter bubble is a state of intellectual isolation[1] that arises when personalized searches, recommendation systems, and algorithmic curation selectively presents information to each user. The search results are based on information about the user, such as their location, past click-behavior, and search history.[2] As a result, users are increasingly exposed to information that reinforces their existing beliefs while also separating themselves from content that challenges them. This has effectively enclosed individuals from a cultural or ideological bubble, resulting in a narrow and more customized view of the world.[3] The choices made by these algorithms are only sometimes transparent.[4] Prime examples include Google Personalized Search results and Facebook\u0027s personalized news-stream. However, there are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalized filtering happens and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful, with various studies producing inconclusive results. The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser circa 2010. In Pariser\u0027s influential book under the same name, The Filter Bubble (2011), it was predicted that individualized personalization by algorithmic filtering would lead to intellectual isolation and social fragmentation.[5] The bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse, according to Pariser, but contrasting views regard the effect as minimal[6] and addressable.[7] According to Pariser, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their informational bubble.[8] He related an example in which one user searched Google for \"BP\" and got investment news about BP, while another searcher got information about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, noting that the two search results pages were \"strikingly different\" despite use of the same key words.[8][9][10][6] The results of the U.S. presidential election in 2016 have been associated with the influence of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,[11] and as a result have called into question the effects of the \"filter bubble\" phenomenon on user exposure to fake news and echo chambers,[12] spurring new interest in the term,[13] with many concerned that the phenomenon may harm democracy and well-being by making the effects of misinformation worse.[14][15][13][16][17][18] Concept [edit] The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser, circa 2010. Pariser defined his concept of a filter bubble in more formal terms as \"that personal ecosystem of information that\u0027s been catered by these algorithms.\"[8] An internet user\u0027s past browsing and search history is built up over time when they indicate interest in topics by \"clicking links, viewing friends, putting movies in [their] queue, reading news stories,\" and so forth.[19] An internet firm then uses this information to target advertising to the user, or make certain types of information appear more prominently in search results pages.[19] This process is not random, as it operates under a three-step process, per Pariser, who states, \"First, you figure out who people are and what they like. Then, you provide them with content and services that best fit them. Finally, you tune in to get the fit just right. Your identity shapes your media.\"[20] Pariser also reports: According to one Wall Street Journal study, the top fifty Internet sites, from CNN to Yahoo to MSN, install an average of 64 data-laden cookies and personal tracking beacons. Search for a word like \"depression\" on Dictionary.com, and the site installs up to 223 tracking cookies and beacons on your computer so that other Web sites can target you with antidepressants. Share an article about cooking on ABC News, and you may be chased around the Web by ads for Teflon-coated pots.

In a test seeking to demonstrate the filter bubble effect, Pariser asked several friends to search for the word \"Egypt\" on Googl",

Inc. Spouse Angela Buenning Children 1 David Robert Filo (born April 20, 1966) is an American billionaire businessman and the co-founder of Yahoo! with classmate Jerry Yang. His Filo Server Program, written in the C programming language, was the server-side software used to dynamically serve variable web pages, called Filo Server Pages, on visits to early versions of the Yahoo! website.[2][3] Early life and education [edit] Filo was born in Wisconsin and was raised in Moss Bluff, Louisiana.[citation needed] He earned a B.S. degree in computer engineering at Tulane University (through the Dean\u0027s Honor Scholarship) and an M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1990 at Stanford University.[4] Career [edit] In February 1994, he co-created with Jerry Yang an Internet website called \"Jerry and David\u0027s Guide to the World Wide Web\", consisting of a directory of other websites. It was renamed \"Yahoo!\" - a common exclamation. Yahoo! became very popular, and Filo and Yang realized the business potential and co-founded Yahoo! Inc.[5][6] Yahoo! started off as a web portal with a web directory providing an extensive range of products and services for various online activities. Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. It is still one of the leading internet brands and, due to partnerships with telecommunications firms, is one of the most visited websites on the internet.[7][8] Personal life [edit] Filo is married to photographer and teacher Angela Buenning, a graduate of Stanford (1993) and Berkeley (1999).[9] They have one child, and live in Palo Alto, California.[4] In 2005, he gave $30 million to his alma mater, Tulane University, for use in its School of Engineering.[4] The Filos have been major benefactors of both Stanford, especially its schools of sustainability and education, and Berkeley, primarily its graduate school of journalism.[10][11][12] As of September 2019, Forbes estimated Filo to be worth $4.3 billion, ranking him the 379th-richest person in the world.[4] References [edit] ^ Centennial Year Commencement Exercises, Stanford University, June 16, 1991, p. 69, archived from the original on December 22, 2019, retrieved June 26, 2018 ^ Gobry, Pascal-Emmanuel. \"10 Behind-The-Scenes Crankers Who Built The World\u0027s Greatest Startups\".

Advertising aims to present a product or service in terms of utility, advantages, and qualities of interest to consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are a wide range of uses, the most common being commercial advertisement. Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through \"branding\", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations, and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images, he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.[1] Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, \"Madison Avenue\" advertising.[2][3] Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion.[4] Advertising\u0027s projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor, and 4.3% on radio.[5] Internationally, the largest (\"Big Five\") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu.[6] History Main article: History of advertising Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at Jinan, Song dynasty China. It is the world\u0027s earliest identified printed advertising medium. Edo period LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called Kinseitan Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters.[7] Commercial messages and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of Pompeii and ancient Arabia. Lost and found advertising on papyrus was common in ancient Greece and ancient Rome. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian rock art paintings that date back to 4000 BC.[8] In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the Classic of Poetry (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell confectionery. Advertisement usually takes the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper pri",

    "title": "Social search - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Act of retrieving and searching on a social searching engine Social search is a behavior of retrieving and searching on a social searching engine that mainly searches user-generated content such as news, videos and images related search queries on social media like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Flickr.[1] It is an enhanced version of web search that combines traditional algorithms. The idea behind social search is that instead of ranking search results purely based on semantic relevance between a query and the results, a social search system also takes into account social relationships between the results and the searcher.[2][3][4] The social relationships could be in various forms. For example, in LinkedIn people search engine, the social relationships include social connections between searcher and each result, whether or not they are in the same industries, work for the same companies, belong the same social groups, and go the same schools, etc.[2][5] Social search may not be demonstrably better than algorithm-driven search.[6] In the algorithmic ranking model that search engines used in the past, relevance of a site is determined after analyzing the text and content on the page and link structure of the document. In contrast, search results with social search highlight content that was created or touched by other users who are in the Social Graph of the person conducting a search. It is a personalized search technology with online community filtering to produce highly personalized results.[7] Social search takes many forms, ranging from simple shared bookmarks or tagging of content with descriptive labels to more sophisticated approaches that combine human intelligence with computer algorithms. Depending on the feature-set of a particular search engine, these results may then be saved and added to community search results, further improving the relevance of results for future searches of that keyword. The principle behind social search is that human network oriented results would be more meaningful and relevant for the user, instead of computer algorithms deciding the results for specific queries.[8][9][10][11] Research and implementations [edit] Over the years, there have been different studies, researches and some implementations of Social Search. In 2008, there were a few startup companies that focused on ranking search results according to one\u0027s social graph on social networks.[12][13] Companies in the social search space include Sproose, Mahalo, Jumper 2.0, Scour, Wink, Eurekster, and Delver. Former efforts include Wikia Search. In 2008, a story on TechCrunch showed Google potentially adding in a voting mechanism to search results similar to Digg\u0027s methodology.[14] This suggests growing interest in how social groups can influence and potentially enhance the ability of algorithms to find meaningful data for end users. There are also other services like Sentiment that turn search personal by searching within the users\u0027 social circles. In 2009, a startup project called HeyStaks (www.heystaks.com) developed a web browser plugin \"HayStaks\". HeyStaks applies social search through collaboration in web search as a way that leads to better search results.[15] The main motivation for HeyStaks to work on this idea is to provide the user with features that search engines didn\u0027t provide at that time. For instance, different searches have indicated that about 70% of the time when user search for something, a friend or a coworker have found it already. Also, studies have shown that approximately, 30% of people who use online search, search for something that they have found before.[16] The startup believe that they help avoid these kind of issues by providing a shared and rich search experience through a list of recommendations that get generated based on search results. In October 2009, Google rolled out its \"Social Search\"; after a time in beta, the feature was expanded to multiple languages in May 2011. Before the expansion however in 2010 Bing and Google were already taking into account re-tweets and Likes when providing search results.[17] However, after a search deal with Twitter ended without renewal, Google began to retool its Social Search. In January 2012, Google released \"Search plus Your World\", a further development of Social Search. The feature, which is integrated into Google\u0027s regular search as an opt-out feature, pulls references to results from Google+ profiles. The goal was to deliver better, more relevant and personalized search results with this integration. This integration however had some problems in which Google+ still is not wildly adopted or has much usage among many users.[18] Later on, Google was criticized by Twitter for the perceived potential impact of \"Search plus Your World\" upon web publishers, describing the feature\u0027s release to the public as a \"bad day for the web\", while Google replied that Twitter refused to ",

The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable. To enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF)[2] and Web Ontology Language (OWL)[3] are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.[4] These standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\"[5] The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems. History [edit] The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web)[6] that can be processed by machines[7]—that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in library and information science, industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.[8] Berners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web in 1999 as follows: I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.[9] The 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web.[10] In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: \"This simple idea…remains largely unrealized\".[11] In 2013, more than four million Web domains (out of roughly 250 million total) contained Semantic Web markup.[12] Example [edit] In the following example, the text \"Paul Schuster was born in Dresden\" on a website will be annotated, connecting a person with their place of birth. The following HTML fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in RDFa-syntax using a schema.org vocabulary and a Wikidata ID: \u003cdiv vocab\u003d\"https://schema.org/\" typeof\u003d\"Person\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan property\u003d\"name\"\u003ePaul Schuster\u003c/span\u003e was born in\n  \u003cspan property\u003d\"birthPlace\" typeof\u003d\"Place\" href\u003d\"https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\"\u003e\n    \u003cspan property\u003d\"name\"\u003eDresden\u003c/span\u003e.\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n Graph resulting from the RDFa example The example defines the following five triples (shown in Turtle syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the subject) is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the predicate) the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the object) either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).  _:a \u003chttps://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/Person\u003e .\n _:a \u003chttps://schema.org/name\u003e \"Paul Schuster\" .\n _:a \u003chttps://schema.org/birthPlace\u003e \u003chttps://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\u003e .\n \u003chttps://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/itemtype\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/Place\u003e .\n \u003chttps://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/name\u003e \"Dresden\" .\n The triples result in the graph shown in the given figure.

As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO involves understanding how search engines operate, the algorithms that shape their results, the information users seek, the keywords and queries they enter, and the specific search engines favored by the intended audience. SEO helps websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher within a search engine results page (SERP), aiming to either convert the visitors or build brand awareness.[5] History Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Search engine users would query the URL of a page, and then receive information found on the page, if it existed in the search engine\u0027s index. ALIWEB and the earliest versions of search engines required website developers to manually upload website index files in order to be searchable and widely did not utilize any form of ranking algorithm for user queries.[6] The emergence of automated web crawlers would later be used to proactively discover and index websites. This led to website developers to optimize their website’s search signals, including the use of meta tags, to achieve greater visibility in search results. According to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current Google employee Danny Sullivan, the phrase \"search engine optimization\" came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits SEO practitioner Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.[7] In some cases, early search algorithms weighted particular HTML attributes in ways that could be leveraged by web content providers to manipulate their search rankings.[8] As early as 1997, search engine providers began adjusting their algorithms to prevent these actions.[9] Eventually, search engines would incorporate more meaningful measures of page purpose, including the more recent development of semantic search.[10] Some search engines frequently sponsor SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization.[11][12] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website.[13] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the \"crawl rate\", and track the web pages index status. In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products, resulting in brands and marketers shifting toward mobile-first experiences.[14] In the 2020s, the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini gave rise to discussion around a concept variously referred to as generative engine optimization, answer engine optimization or artificial intelligence optimization. This approach focuses on optimizing content for inclusion in AI-generated answers provided by large language models (LLMs). This shift has led digital marketers to discuss content formats, authority signals, and how stru",

Originally containing digitized back issues of academic journals, it now encompasses books and other primary sources as well as current issues of journals in the humanities and social sciences.[3] It provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals. Most access is by subscription but some of the site is public domain, and open access content is available free of charge.[4] JSTOR is part of the non-profit US academic digital library and learning platform provider, Ithaka Harbors, Inc.[5] History [edit] William G. Bowen, president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988,[6] founded JSTOR in 1994. JSTOR was originally conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially research and university libraries, due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text searchability improved access dramatically.[7] Bowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution.[8] However, Ira Fuchs, Princeton University\u0027s vice president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was becoming an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility (for example, all Princeton\u0027s administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as BITNET and the Internet). JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals. JSTOR access improved based on feedback from its initial sites, and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary web browser. Special software was put in place to make pictures and graphs clear and readable.[9] With the success of this limited project, Bowen, Fuchs, and Kevin Guthrie, the then-president of JSTOR, wanted to expand the number of participating journals. They met with representatives of the Royal Society of London and an agreement was made to digitize the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society dating from its beginning in 1665. The work of adding these volumes to JSTOR was completed by December 2000.[9] In 1999 JSTOR started a partnership with Joint Information Systems Committee and created a mirror website at the University of Manchester to make the JSTOR database available to over 20 higher education institutions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[10] The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009, JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining nonprofit organization with offices in New York City and in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit Ithaka Harbors, Inc.[5]—a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and \"dedicated to helping the academic community take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies\".[1] In 2019, JSTOR\u0027s revenue was $79 million.[11] Content [edit] JSTOR content is provided by more than 900 publishers.[12] The database contains more than 12 million journal articles, in more than 75 disciplines.[5] Each object is uniquely identified by an integer value, starting at 1, which is used to create a stable URL.[13] In addition to the main site, the JSTOR labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of corpus analysis at its Data for Research service.[14] This site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main JSTOR site. Users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and n-gram frequencies and basic metadata. They are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either XML or CSV formats. The service does not offer full-text, although academics may request that from JSTOR, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.[citation needed] JSTOR Plant Science[15] is available in addition to the m",

It allows users to search for information on the Web by entering keywords or phrases. Google Search uses algorithms to analyze and rank websites based on their relevance to the search query. Google Search is the most-visited website in the world. As of 2025, Google Search has a 90% share of the global search engine market.[3] Approximately 24.1% of Google\u0027s monthly global traffic comes from the United States, 5.6% from India, 5.5% from Japan, 4.8% from Brazil, and 3.7% from the United Kingdom according to data provided by Similarweb. The same source reports that 58% of users are male and 42% are female.[4] The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called \"PageRank\". Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more. The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1996 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan.[5][6][7] The search engine would also be set up in the garage of Susan Wojcicki\u0027s Menlo Park home.[8] In 2011, Google introduced \"Google Voice Search\" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words.[9] In 2012, Google introduced a semantic search feature named Knowledge Graph. Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends.[10] Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google\u0027s search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks.[11] In August 2024, a US judge in Virginia ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly over Internet search and search advertising.[12][13] The court found that Google maintained its market dominance by paying large amounts to phone-makers and browser-developers to make Google its default search engine.[13] In April 2025, the trial to determine which remedies sought by the Department of Justice would be imposed to address Google\u0027s illegal monopoly, which could include breaking up the company and preventing it from using its data to secure dominance in the AI sector.[needs update][14] Search indexing See also: Googlebot Google indexes hundreds of terabytes of information from web pages.[15] Before 2024,[16] Google also provided desktop users links to cached versions of their search results, formed by the search engine\u0027s latest indexing of the website in question.[17] Additionally, Google indexes some file types, being able to show users PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, certain Flash multimedia content, and plain text files.[18] Users can also activate \"SafeSearch\", a filtering technology aimed at preventing explicit and pornographic content from appearing in search results.[19] Despite Google search\u0027s immense index, sources generally assume that Google is only indexing less than 5% of the total Internet, with the rest belonging to the deep web, inaccessible through its search tools.[15][20][21] In 2012, Google changed its search indexing tools to demote sites that had been accused of piracy.[22] In October 2016, Gary Illyes, a webmaster trends analyst with Google, announced that the search engine would be making a separate, primary web index dedicated for mobile devices, with a secondary, less up-to-date index for desktop use. The change was a response to the continued growth in mobile usage, and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites.[23][24] In December 2017, Google began rolling out the change, having already done so for multiple websites.[25] \"Caffeine\" search architecture upgrade In August 2009, Google invited web developers to test a new search architecture, codenamed \"Caffeine\", and give their feedback.

Though Perl is not officially an acronym,[8] there are various backronyms in use, including \"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\".[9] Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.[10][11] Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl originally was not capitalized and the name was changed to being capitalized by the time Perl 4 was released.[11] The latest release is Perl 5, first released in 1994. From 2000 to October 2019 a sixth version of Perl was in development; the sixth version\u0027s name was changed to Raku.[12][13] Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams which liberally borrow ideas from each other. Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, sh, AWK, and sed.[1] It provides text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools.[14] Perl is a highly expressive programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short and highly compressible.[15][16] Perl gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities.[17][18][19][20] In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It has been nicknamed \"the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\" because of its flexibility and power.[21] In 1998, it was also referred to as the \"duct tape that holds the Internet together\", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.[22] Name and logos [edit] The Camel symbol used by O\u0027Reilly Media The onion logo used by The Perl Foundation Perl was originally named \"Pearl\". Wall wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations.[23] However, Wall discovered the existing PEARL language before Perl\u0027s official release and dropped the \"a\" from the name.[24] The name is occasionally expanded as a backronym: Practical Extraction and Report Language[25] and Wall\u0027s own Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister, which is in the manual page for perl.[26] Programming Perl, published by O\u0027Reilly Media, features a picture of a dromedary camel on the cover and is commonly called the \"Camel Book\".[27] This image has become an unofficial symbol of Perl. O\u0027Reilly owns the image as a trademark but licenses it for non-commercial use, requiring only an acknowledgement and a link to www.perl.com. Licensing for commercial use is decided on a case-by-case basis.[28] O\u0027Reilly also provides \"Programming Republic of Perl\" logos for non-commercial sites and \"Powered by Perl\" buttons for any site that uses Perl.[28] The Perl Foundation owns an alternative symbol, an onion, which it licenses to its subsidiaries, Perl Mongers, PerlMonks, Perl.org, and others.[29] The symbol is a visual pun on pearl onion.[30] In 2024, a new camel logo for the language was published[31] under a Creative Commons license by a small group of developers. While not an official logo, it is intended to represent both the language and the community and draws on Perl\u0027s longtime association with the camel from the O\u0027Reilly book. History [edit] Early versions [edit] Larry Wall began work on Perl in 1987, while employed as a programmer at Unisys;[14] he released version 1.0 on December 18, 1987.[1] Wall based early Perl on some methods existing languages used for text manipulation. Perl 2, released in June 1988,[32][33] featured a better regular expression engine. Perl 3, released in October 1989,[32] added support for binary data streams.[34] 1990s [edit] Main article: Perl 5 version history Originally, the only documentation for Perl was a single lengthy man page.

It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia\u0027s categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing \"attention en masse\" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone\u0027s earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). This category combines all Wikipedia articles with style issues from June 2025 (2025-06) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Wikipedia articles with style issues by month.

Sproose provided web search results from partners including MSN, Yahoo! and Ask.com. Sproose intended to have better-quality results than algorithmic search engines because its users were able to influence the ranking order of the search results by voting for websites (which moved them up in the order of search results) and deleting bad or spam results. It had been compared to Digg[2] and Mahalo.com,[3] among other social search websites. The domain sproose.com is now owned by a British artist. Use of the site [edit] Registration was not required to search on Sproose. If a user voted for a website, the vote was saved temporarily. In order to save the voted sites permanently, a user had to sign up for an account. When a user registered with Sproose, a personal profile page was created. Each time a site was voted on, a thumbnail and URL of the site would be posted on the user\u0027s profile page, which may be public or private. Users could comment on each website; comments were visible to other users. In January 2009, Sproose launched a recommendation engine[4] and voting platform. The recommendation engine allowed users to rate and vote for content on partnered websites, and it allowed for more information to be delivered to a user from the partnered site. It also allowed sharing of information through its \"widgets\"[5] on social networks such as Facebook. Company background [edit] Sproose was privately held. The management team was:[6] Bob Pack – Founder and CEO Gus Bourg – Vice President of Search Technology Steve Bourg – Vice President of Network Technology Stefan Groschupf – CTO References [edit] ^ \"Social search engine Sproose final now live\", Lifehacker, August 29, 2007 ^ \"Sproose does social search, bookmarking\", Webware, June 4, 2007 ^ \"Sproose: Human Powered Search Meets Digg\", TechCrunch, June 1, 2007 ^ Recommendation Engine description on Sproose.com ^ Widget description on Sproose.com ^ Corporate Facts on Sproose.com Retrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title\u003dSproose\u0026oldid\u003d1091794330\" Category: Internet search engines Hidden categories: Articles with short description Short description matches Wikidata Use mdy dates from June 2013 Search Search Sproose 1 language Add topic",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Not to be confused with Multimodal search. Multisearch is a class of multitasking search engine which includes both search engine and metasearch engine characteristics with additional capability of retrieval of search result sets that were previously classified by users.[1] It enables the user to gather results from its own search index as well as from one or more search engines, metasearch engines, databases or any such kind of information retrieval (IR) programs. Multisearch is an emerging feature of automated search and information retrieval systems which combines the capabilities of computer search programs with results classification made by a human. Multisearch is a way to take advantage of the power of multiple search engines with a flexibility not seen in traditional metasearch engines. To the end user, a multisearch may appear to be just a customizable search engine; however, its behind-the-scenes technology enables it to put a face to the search process and to retrieve and display also a results set which has been classified by a human during a multisearch session and automatically included in the documents index. There are additional features available in many search engines and metasearch engines, but the basic idea is the same: reducing the amount of time required to search for resources by improvement of the accuracy and relevance of individual searches as well as the ability to manage the results.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Hypothetical proto-hypertext system that was first described by Vannevar Bush in 1945 For the software company, see Memex Technology Limited. Interpretation of the MEMEX at German Museum of Technology Vannevar Bush A memex (a portmanteau of \"memory\" and \"index\") is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush\u0027s 1945 article \"As We May Think\". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, \"mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility\". The individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex \"an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory\".[1] The concept of the memex influenced the development of early hypertext systems and personal knowledge base software.[2] The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for the purpose of concrete illustration was based upon a document bookmark list of static microfilm pages and lacked a true hypertext system, where parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the common textual format. Development [edit] An electromechanical memex device [edit] In \"As We May Think\", Vannevar Bush describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. This device would closely mimic the associative processes of the human mind, but it would be gifted with permanent recollection. As Bush writes, \"Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race\".[3] The technology used would have been a combination of electromechanical controls and microfilm cameras and readers, all integrated into a large desk. Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will. A memex would hypothetically read and write content on these microfilm reels, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails. The top of the desk would have slanting translucent screens on which material could be projected for convenient reading. The top of the memex would have a transparent platen. When a longhand note, photograph, memoranda, or other things were placed on the platen, the depression of a lever would cause the item to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film. According to Bush, the memex could become \"a sort of mechanized private file and library\".[4] The memex device as described by Bush \"would use microfilm storage, dry photography, and analog computing to give postwar scholars access to a huge, indexed repository of knowledge any section of which could be called up with a few keystrokes.\"[5] Associative trails [edit] An associative trail as conceived by Bush would be a way to create a new linear sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and side trails. At the time, Bush saw the current ways of indexing information as limiting and instead proposed a way to store information that was analogous to the mental association of the human brain: storing information with the capability of easy access at a later time using certain cues (in this case, a series of numbers as a code to retrieve data).[6] Other features [edit] According to Bush, the memex would have features other than linking. The user could record new information on microfilm, by taking photos from paper or from a touch-sensitive translucent screen. A user could \"...insert a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. ...Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.\"[7] A user could also create a copy of an interesting trail (containing references and personal annotations) and \"...pass it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.\"[7] In September 1945, Life magazine published an illustration by Alfred D. Crimi showing the \"Memex desk\". According to Life magazine, the Memex desk \"would instantly bring files and material on an subject to the operator\u0027s fingertips\". The mechanical core of the desk would also include \"a mechanism which automatically photographs longhand notes, pictures and letters, then file them in the desk for future reference.\"[8] Extending, storing, and consulting the record of the species",
