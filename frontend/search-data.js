Originally containing digitized back issues of academic journals, it now encompasses books and other primary sources as well as current issues of journals in the humanities and social sciences.[3] It provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals. Most access is by subscription but some of the site is public domain, and open access content is available free of charge.[4] JSTOR is part of the non-profit US academic digital library and learning platform provider, Ithaka Harbors, Inc.[5] History [edit] William G. Bowen, president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988,[6] founded JSTOR in 1994. JSTOR was originally conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially research and university libraries, due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text searchability improved access dramatically.[7] Bowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution.[8] However, Ira Fuchs, Princeton University\u0027s vice president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was becoming an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility (for example, all Princeton\u0027s administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as BITNET and the Internet). JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals. JSTOR access improved based on feedback from its initial sites, and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary web browser. Special software was put in place to make pictures and graphs clear and readable.[9] With the success of this limited project, Bowen, Fuchs, and Kevin Guthrie, the then-president of JSTOR, wanted to expand the number of participating journals. They met with representatives of the Royal Society of London and an agreement was made to digitize the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society dating from its beginning in 1665. The work of adding these volumes to JSTOR was completed by December 2000.[9] In 1999 JSTOR started a partnership with Joint Information Systems Committee and created a mirror website at the University of Manchester to make the JSTOR database available to over 20 higher education institutions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[10] The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009, JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining nonprofit organization with offices in New York City and in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit Ithaka Harbors, Inc.[5]—a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and \"dedicated to helping the academic community take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies\".[1] In 2019, JSTOR\u0027s revenue was $79 million.[11] Content [edit] JSTOR content is provided by more than 900 publishers.[12] The database contains more than 12 million journal articles, in more than 75 disciplines.[5] Each object is uniquely identified by an integer value, starting at 1, which is used to create a stable URL.[13] In addition to the main site, the JSTOR labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of corpus analysis at its Data for Research service.[14] This site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main JSTOR site. Users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and n-gram frequencies and basic metadata. They are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either XML or CSV formats. The service does not offer full-text, although academics may request that from JSTOR, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.[citation needed] JSTOR Plant Science[15] is available in addition to the m",

It allows users to search for information on the Web by entering keywords or phrases. Google Search uses algorithms to analyze and rank websites based on their relevance to the search query. Google Search is the most-visited website in the world. As of 2025, Google Search has a 90% share of the global search engine market.[3] Approximately 24.1% of Google\u0027s monthly global traffic comes from the United States, 5.6% from India, 5.5% from Japan, 4.8% from Brazil, and 3.7% from the United Kingdom according to data provided by Similarweb. The same source reports that 58% of users are male and 42% are female.[4] The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called \"PageRank\". Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more. The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1996 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan.[5][6][7] The search engine would also be set up in the garage of Susan Wojcicki\u0027s Menlo Park home.[8] In 2011, Google introduced \"Google Voice Search\" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words.[9] In 2012, Google introduced a semantic search feature named Knowledge Graph. Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends.[10] Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google\u0027s search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks.[11] In August 2024, a US judge in Virginia ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly over Internet search and search advertising.[12][13] The court found that Google maintained its market dominance by paying large amounts to phone-makers and browser-developers to make Google its default search engine.[13] In April 2025, the trial to determine which remedies sought by the Department of Justice would be imposed to address Google\u0027s illegal monopoly, which could include breaking up the company and preventing it from using its data to secure dominance in the AI sector.[needs update][14] Search indexing See also: Googlebot Google indexes hundreds of terabytes of information from web pages.[15] Before 2024,[16] Google also provided desktop users links to cached versions of their search results, formed by the search engine\u0027s latest indexing of the website in question.[17] Additionally, Google indexes some file types, being able to show users PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, certain Flash multimedia content, and plain text files.[18] Users can also activate \"SafeSearch\", a filtering technology aimed at preventing explicit and pornographic content from appearing in search results.[19] Despite Google search\u0027s immense index, sources generally assume that Google is only indexing less than 5% of the total Internet, with the rest belonging to the deep web, inaccessible through its search tools.[15][20][21] In 2012, Google changed its search indexing tools to demote sites that had been accused of piracy.[22] In October 2016, Gary Illyes, a webmaster trends analyst with Google, announced that the search engine would be making a separate, primary web index dedicated for mobile devices, with a secondary, less up-to-date index for desktop use. The change was a response to the continued growth in mobile usage, and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites.[23][24] In December 2017, Google began rolling out the change, having already done so for multiple websites.[25] \"Caffeine\" search architecture upgrade In August 2009, Google invited web developers to test a new search architecture, codenamed \"Caffeine\", and give their feedback. The new architecture provided no visual differences in the use",

Though Perl is not officially an acronym,[8] there are various backronyms in use, including \"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\".[9] Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.[10][11] Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl originally was not capitalized and the name was changed to being capitalized by the time Perl 4 was released.[11] The latest release is Perl 5, first released in 1994. From 2000 to October 2019 a sixth version of Perl was in development; the sixth version\u0027s name was changed to Raku.[12][13] Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams which liberally borrow ideas from each other. Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, sh, AWK, and sed.[1] It provides text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools.[14] Perl is a highly expressive programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short and highly compressible.[15][16] Perl gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities.[17][18][19][20] In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It has been nicknamed \"the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\" because of its flexibility and power.[21] In 1998, it was also referred to as the \"duct tape that holds the Internet together\", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.[22] Name and logos [edit] The Camel symbol used by O\u0027Reilly Media The onion logo used by The Perl Foundation Perl was originally named \"Pearl\". Wall wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations.[23] However, Wall discovered the existing PEARL language before Perl\u0027s official release and dropped the \"a\" from the name.[24] The name is occasionally expanded as a backronym: Practical Extraction and Report Language[25] and Wall\u0027s own Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister, which is in the manual page for perl.[26] Programming Perl, published by O\u0027Reilly Media, features a picture of a dromedary camel on the cover and is commonly called the \"Camel Book\".[27] This image has become an unofficial symbol of Perl. O\u0027Reilly owns the image as a trademark but licenses it for non-commercial use, requiring only an acknowledgement and a link to www.perl.com. Licensing for commercial use is decided on a case-by-case basis.[28] O\u0027Reilly also provides \"Programming Republic of Perl\" logos for non-commercial sites and \"Powered by Perl\" buttons for any site that uses Perl.[28] The Perl Foundation owns an alternative symbol, an onion, which it licenses to its subsidiaries, Perl Mongers, PerlMonks, Perl.org, and others.[29] The symbol is a visual pun on pearl onion.[30] In 2024, a new camel logo for the language was published[31] under a Creative Commons license by a small group of developers. While not an official logo, it is intended to represent both the language and the community and draws on Perl\u0027s longtime association with the camel from the O\u0027Reilly book. History [edit] Early versions [edit] Larry Wall began work on Perl in 1987, while employed as a programmer at Unisys;[14] he released version 1.0 on December 18, 1987.[1] Wall based early Perl on some methods existing languages used for text manipulation. Perl 2, released in June 1988,[32][33] featured a better regular expression engine. Perl 3, released in October 1989,[32] added support for binary data streams.[34] 1990s [edit] Main article: Perl 5 version history Originally, the only documentation for Perl was a single lengthy man page.

Sproose provided web search results from partners including MSN, Yahoo! and Ask.com. Sproose intended to have better-quality results than algorithmic search engines because its users were able to influence the ranking order of the search results by voting for websites (which moved them up in the order of search results) and deleting bad or spam results. It had been compared to Digg[2] and Mahalo.com,[3] among other social search websites. The domain sproose.com is now owned by a British artist. Use of the site [edit] Registration was not required to search on Sproose. If a user voted for a website, the vote was saved temporarily. In order to save the voted sites permanently, a user had to sign up for an account. When a user registered with Sproose, a personal profile page was created. Each time a site was voted on, a thumbnail and URL of the site would be posted on the user\u0027s profile page, which may be public or private. Users could comment on each website; comments were visible to other users. In January 2009, Sproose launched a recommendation engine[4] and voting platform. The recommendation engine allowed users to rate and vote for content on partnered websites, and it allowed for more information to be delivered to a user from the partnered site. It also allowed sharing of information through its \"widgets\"[5] on social networks such as Facebook. Company background [edit] Sproose was privately held.

Multisearch is a class of multitasking search engine which includes both search engine and metasearch engine characteristics with additional capability of retrieval of search result sets that were previously classified by users.[1] It enables the user to gather results from its own search index as well as from one or more search engines, metasearch engines, databases or any such kind of information retrieval (IR) programs. Multisearch is an emerging feature of automated search and information retrieval systems which combines the capabilities of computer search programs with results classification made by a human. Multisearch is a way to take advantage of the power of multiple search engines with a flexibility not seen in traditional metasearch engines. To the end user, a multisearch may appear to be just a customizable search engine; however, its behind-the-scenes technology enables it to put a face to the search process and to retrieve and display also a results set which has been classified by a human during a multisearch session and automatically included in the documents index. There are additional features available in many search engines and metasearch engines, but the basic idea is the same: reducing the amount of time required to search for resources by improvement of the accuracy and relevance of individual searches as well as the ability to manage the results.

The individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex \"an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory\".[1] The concept of the memex influenced the development of early hypertext systems and personal knowledge base software.[2] The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for the purpose of concrete illustration was based upon a document bookmark list of static microfilm pages and lacked a true hypertext system, where parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the common textual format. Development [edit] An electromechanical memex device [edit] In \"As We May Think\", Vannevar Bush describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. This device would closely mimic the associative processes of the human mind, but it would be gifted with permanent recollection. As Bush writes, \"Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race\".[3] The technology used would have been a combination of electromechanical controls and microfilm cameras and readers, all integrated into a large desk. Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will. A memex would hypothetically read and write content on these microfilm reels, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails. The top of the desk would have slanting translucent screens on which material could be projected for convenient reading. The top of the memex would have a transparent platen. When a longhand note, photograph, memoranda, or other things were placed on the platen, the depression of a lever would cause the item to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film. According to Bush, the memex could become \"a sort of mechanized private file and library\".[4] The memex device as described by Bush \"would use microfilm storage, dry photography, and analog computing to give postwar scholars access to a huge, indexed repository of knowledge any section of which could be called up with a few keystrokes.\"[5] Associative trails [edit] An associative trail as conceived by Bush would be a way to create a new linear sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and side trails. At the time, Bush saw the current ways of indexing information as limiting and instead proposed a way to store information that was analogous to the mental association of the human brain: storing information with the capability of easy access at a later time using certain cues (in this case, a series of numbers as a code to retrieve data).[6] Other features [edit] According to Bush, the memex would have features other than linking. The user could record new information on microfilm, by taking photos from paper or from a touch-sensitive translucent screen. A user could \"...insert a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. ...Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.\"[7] A user could also create a copy of an interesting trail (containing references and personal annotations) and \"...pass it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.\"[7] In September 1945, Life magazine published an illustration by Alfred D. Crimi showing the \"Memex desk\". According to Life magazine, the Memex desk \"would instantly bring files and material on an subject to the operator\u0027s fingertips\". The mechanical core of the desk would also include \"a mechanism which automatically photographs longhand notes, pictures and letters, then file them in the desk for future reference.\"[8] Extending, storing, and consulting the record of the species",

The information need can be specified in the form of a search query. In the case of document retrieval, queries can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science[1] of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds. Cross-modal retrieval implies retrieval across modalities. Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload. An IR system is a software system that provides access to books, journals and other documents; it also stores and manages those documents. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications. Overview [edit] An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance. An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.[2] Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,[3] audio,[4] mind maps[5] or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata. Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.[6] History [edit] there is ... a machine called the Univac ... whereby letters and figures are coded as a pattern of magnetic spots on a long steel tape. By this means the text of a document, preceded by its subject code symbol, can be recorded ... the machine ... automatically selects and types out those references which have been coded in any desired way at a rate of 120 words a minute — J. E. Holmstrom, 1948 The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article As We May Think by Vannevar Bush in 1945.[7] It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a \u0027statistical machine\u0027 – filed by Emanuel Goldberg in the 1920s and 1930s – that searched for documents stored on film.[8] The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948,[9] detailing an early mention of the Univac computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy Desk Set. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by Gerard Salton at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents).[7] Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s. In 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cosponsored the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very la",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Content provided by a website The home page of NASA from 2008 A web page (or webpage) is a Web document that is accessed in a web browser.[1] A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The term \"web page\" is therefore a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book. Navigation [edit] Main article: Web navigation Each article on the Wikipedia website is a distinct web page. The URL is visible in the browser\u0027s address bar at the top. Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their web browser, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then transforms it into an interactive visual representation on the user\u0027s screen.[2] If the user clicks or taps a link, the browser repeats this process to load the new URL, which could be part of the current website or a different one. The browser has features, such as the address bar, that indicate which page is displayed. Elements [edit] A web page is a structured document. The core element is a text file written in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This specifies the content of the page,[3] including images and video. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specify the presentation of the page.[3] CSS rules can be in separate text files or embedded within the HTML file. The vast majority[4] of pages have JavaScript programs, enabling a wide range of behavior.[3] The newer WebAssembly language can also be used as a supplement.[5] The most sophisticated web pages, known as web apps, combine these elements in a complex manner. Deployment [edit] From the perspective of server-side website deployment, there are two types of web pages: static and dynamic. Static pages are retrieved from the web server\u0027s file system without any modification,[6] while dynamic pages must be created by the server on the fly, typically reading from a database to fill out a template, before being sent to the user\u0027s browser.[7] An example of a dynamic page is a search engine results page. Security [edit] The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the way a web browser retrieves webpage content from a website. HTTP has two optional security features: encrypted mode (HTTPS) greatly reduces the possibility of eavesdropping by a third party,[8] while Content Security Policy protects against cross-site scripting attacks.[9] Both features are supported by mainstream web browsers, and many websites use them.

But now, there is a new force in the universe... the Hotomi Bot(1) threatens to tear apart the very fabric of the web! Personal Sob Story Introduction My earliest encounter with the World Wide Web was during my freshman year at MIT. I was working late one night at the Media Lab, a lowly research assistant trying to learn the ropes of a technology that nobody outside of the lab, let alone myself, knew anything about. Suddenly an e-mail from one of the other late-night vigilantes (it was 4 A.M., but most of the workstations were occupied) came across the lab network. The message was about some new global document-sharing network. By adding a few header tags to research papers, the message claimed, one could publish them in such a way that scientists in other labs all around the world could access them easily. I hadn\u0027t written anything worth reading yet, and I\u0027d already read enough cryptic research papers for one night, so I deleted the e-mail and starting searching the file server for cool games. That was around April or May of 1993. About that same time, www.mit.edu went online as one of the first 100 web servers in the world. Naturally, this was not MIT\u0027s official homepage(2), because at that point, nobody had homepages. It was actually a server set up by a bunch of students that collectively called themselves SIPB (the Student Information Processing Board). Their pages provided a central starting place for exploring MIT\u0027s web sites, providing helpful information for \"surfers\" who were still confused by the whole concept.(3) Bow down and give thanks to Archie The grandfather of all search engines was Archie, created in 1990 by Alan Emtage, a student at McGill University in Montreal. The author originally wanted to call the program \"archives,\" but had to shorten it to comply with the Unix world standard of assigning programs and files short, cryptic names such as grep, cat, troff, sed, awk, perl, and so on. For more information on where Archie is today, see: http://www.bunyip.com/products/archie/ At the early date of 1990, there was no World Wide Web. Around this time, Tim Burners-Lee probably had a bad dream in which a scary monster with \"HTTP\" etched into its hide slowly ate up all of the Earth\u0027s resources. Nonetheless, there was still an Internet, and many files were scattered all over the vast network. The primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This was (and still is) a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the Internet. It works like this: Some administrator decides that he wants to make files available from his computer. He sets up a program on his computer, called an FTP server. When someone on the Internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer, he or she connects to it via another program called an FTP client. Any FTP client program can connect with any FTP server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the FTP protocol. Initially, anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an FTP server in order to make the file available to others. Later, \"anonymous\" FTP sites became repositories for files, allowing all users to post and retrieve them. Even with archive sites, many important files were still scattered on small FTP servers. Unfortunately, these files could be located only by the Internet equivalent of word of mouth: Somebody would post an e-mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file. Archie changed all that. It combined a scr",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Software used to help develop a website or web application The Wikipedia Main Page being inspected using Firefox Web development tools (often abbreviated to dev tools) allow web developers to test, modify and debug their websites. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application. Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in modern web browsers. Browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera have built-in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download centers. Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. History and support [edit] Early web developers manually debugged their websites by commenting out code and using JavaScript functions. One of the first browser debugging tools to exist was Mozilla\u0027s Firebug extension, which possessed many of the current core features of today\u0027s developer tools, leading to Firefox becoming popular with developers at the time. Safari\u0027s WebKit engine also introduced its integrated developer tools around that period, which eventually became the basis for both Safari and Chrome\u0027s current tooling.[1][2][3] Microsoft released a developer toolbar for Internet Explorer 6 and 7; and then integrated them into the browser from version 8 onwards.[4][5] In 2017, Mozilla discontinued Firebug in favour of integrated developer tools.[6] Nowadays, all modern web browsers have support for web developer tools that allow web designers and developers to look at the make-up of their pages. These are all tools that are built into the browser and do not require additional modules or configuration.[7] Firefox – F12 opens the Firefox DevTools.[8] Google Chrome and Opera – Developer Tools (DevTools)[9][10] Microsoft Edge – F12 opens Web Developer Tools.[11][12] Microsoft incorporates additional features that are not included in mainline Chromium.[13] Safari – The Safari Web Inspector has to be enabled from its settings pane.[14][15][3] Features [edit] The built-in web developer tools in the browser are commonly accessed by hovering over an item on a webpage and selecting the \"Inspect Element\" or similar option from the context menu. Alternatively the F12 key tends to be another common shortcut.[7] HTML and the DOM [edit] HTML and DOM viewer and editor is commonly included in the built-in web development tools. The difference between the HTML and DOM viewer, and the view source feature in web browsers is that the HTML and DOM viewer allows you to see the DOM as it was rendered in addition to allowing you to make changes to the HTML and DOM and see the change reflected in the page after the change is made.[16][3][7] In addition to selecting and editing, the HTML elements panels will usually also display properties of the DOM object, such as display dimension, and CSS properties.[17] Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge all allow users to simulate the document on a mobile device by modifying the viewport dimensions and pixel density.[18] Additionally, Firefox and Chrome both have the option to simulate colour blindness for the page.[19] Web page assets, resources and network information [edit] Web pages typically load and require additional content in the form of images, scripts, font and other external files. Web development tools also allow developers to inspect resources that are loaded and available on the web page in a tree-structure listing, and the appearance of style sheets can be tested in real time.[20][21][7] Web development tools also allow developers to view information about the network usage, such as viewing what the loading time and bandwidth usage are and which HTTP headers are being sent and received.[22] Developers can manipulate and resend network requests.[23][18] Profiling and auditing [edit] Profiling allows developers to capture information about the performance of a web page or web application. With this information developers can improve the performance of their scripts. Auditing features may provide developers suggestions, after analyzing a page, for optimizations to decrease page load time and increase responsiveness. Web development tools typically also provide a record of the time it takes to render the page, memory usage, and the types of events which are taking place.[24][25][3] These features allow developers to optimize their web page or web application.[26] JavaScript debugging [edit] JavaScript is commonly used in web browsers.[16] Web development tools commonly include a debugger panel for scripts by allowing developers to add watch expressions, breakpoints, view the call stack, and",

History [edit] Following its 2020 founding, You.com opened its public beta on November 9, 2021,[8] and received $20 million in funding led by Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff.[6][9] Other investors include Breyer Capital, Sound Ventures, and Day One Ventures.[10] The domain You.com was initially purchased in 1996 by Benioff.[11] Benioff invested in You.com and transferred ownership of the You.com domain name to the company.[10] In July 2022, You.com announced its $25 million Series A funding round led by Radical Ventures[12] with participation from Time Ventures, Breyer Capital, Norwest Venture Partners and Day One Ventures.[13] In September 2024, You.com raised $50 million in Series B funding led by Georgian.[14] In September 2025, You.com raised $100 million in Series C funding led by Cox Enterprises at a $1.5 billion valuation, achieving unicorn status.[1] Business Model [edit] You.com generates revenue primarily through enterprise sales of search APIs and AI tools. The platform provides web search capabilities that can be integrated into enterprise applications and AI agents.[15][16] Features [edit] On December 23, 2022, You.com was the first search engine to launch a ChatGPT-style chatbot with live web results alongside its responses.[17][18][19] Initially known as YouChat,[20] the chatbot was primarily based on the GPT-3.5 large language model and could answer questions, suggest ideas,[21] translate text,[22] summarize articles, compose emails, and write code snippets, while staying up-to-date with current events [19] and citing sources. Several further versions of YouChat were released. The second version, called YouChat 2.0, was released on February 7, 2023,[23][24] incorporated improved conversational AI[25] and community-built applications by blending a large language model named C-A-L (Chat, Apps, and Links).[25][20] This update enabled YouChat to provide results in various formats, such as charts,[26] photos,[27] videos, tables, graphs, text or code, so users can find answers without leaving the search results page. YouChat 3.0, unveiled on May 4, 2023,[28] combined chat functionality with results from Reddit, TikTok, Stack Overflow and Wikipedia.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Multimedia search enables information search using queries in multiple data types including text and other multimedia formats. Multimedia search can be implemented through multimodal search interfaces, i.e., interfaces that allow to submit search queries not only as textual requests, but also through other media. We can distinguish two methodologies in multimedia search: Metadata search: the search is made on the layers of metadata. Query by example: The interaction consists in submitting a piece of information (e.g., a video, an image, or a piece of audio) for the purpose of finding similar multimedia items. Metadata search [edit] Search is made using the layers in metadata which contain information of the content of a multimedia file. Metadata search is easier, faster and effective because instead of working with complex material, such as an audio, a video or an image, it searches using text. There are three processes which should be done in this method: Summarization of media content (feature extraction). The result of feature extraction is a description. Filtering of media descriptions (for example, elimination of Redundancy) Categorization of media descriptions into classes. Query by example [edit] In query by example, the element used to search is a multimedia content (image, audio, video). In other words, the query is a media. Often, it\u0027s used audiovisual indexing. It will be necessary to choose the criteria we are going to use for creating metadata. The process of search can be divided in three parts: Generate descriptors for the media which we are going to use as query and the descriptors for the media in our database. Compare descriptors of the query and our database’s media. List the media sorted by maximum coincidence. Multimedia search engine [edit] There are two big search families, in function of the content: Visual search engine Audio search engine Visual search engine [edit] Inside this family we can distinguish two topics: image search and video search Image search: Although usually it\u0027s used simple metadata search, increasingly is being used indexing methods for making the results of users queries more accurate using query by example. For example, QR codes. Video search: Videos can be searched for simple metadata or by complex metadata generated by indexing. The audio contained in the videos is usually scanned by audio search engines. Audio search engine [edit] There are different methods of audio searching: Voice search engine: Allows the user to search using speech instead of text. It uses algorithms of speech recognition. An example of this technology is Google Voice Search.[1] Music search engine: Although most of applications which searches music works on simple metadata (artist, name of track, album…) . There are some programs of music recognition, for example Shazam[2] or SoundHound.

Startpage Screenshot Type of site Search engine Proxy server Available in Multilingual Headquarters Wilhelmina van Pruisenweg 104, The Hague, the Netherlands Owner Surfboard Holding BV Parent System1 URL startpage.com Launched 1998; 27 years ago (1998) (as Ixquick) January 28, 1998; 27 years ago (1998-01-28) (as Startpage) Startpage.com is a Dutch search engine website that highlights privacy as its distinguishing feature.[1][2][3] The website advertises that it allows users to obtain Bing Search and Google Search results while protecting users\u0027 privacy by not storing personal information or search data and removing all trackers.[4] Startpage.com also includes an Anonymous View browsing feature that allows users the option to open search results via proxy for increased anonymity.[5] Startpage is owned and operated by Surfboard Holding BV, The Hague, the Netherlands, which is majority owned by System1, an American internet advertising company. History [edit] Early history [edit] Ixquick was created in 1998 by David Bodnick in New York City.[6] Initially, it provided metasearch for 14 different web and directory search engines as well as images, news, and MP3 engines.[7] Results were sorted after evaluating how relevant each of the search tools found the query.[8] Surfboard Holding BV, a company based in Zeist, Netherlands, and led by CEO Robert E. G. Beens, acquired Ixquick in 2000.[9] Ixquick was re-launched on 23 March 2005 with new features including a redesigned metasearch algorithm.[6][10] The Ixquick webpage as it appeared in 2001 Startpage.com began as a web directory on January 28th, 1998[11] and started mirroring Ixquick in 2003.[12] On 7 July 2009, the company re-launched Startpage.com to fetch results only from the Google search engine.[13] Prior to the release of Tor Browser version 4.5 in April 2015, Startpage.com was its default search engine.[14] Merger and recent history [edit] On 29 March 2016, Ixquick.com was merged into the Startpage.com search engine. However, Ixquick was still available at Ixquick.eu, Ixquick.info and the Ixquick Search App until 2nd of April 2018, when they were discontinued.[15][16][17] As of 2017, Startpage fields an estimated 2 billion searches[quantify]. The company was one of 200 European companies that opposed the F.C.C. implementation of policies ending net neutrality.[18] In October 2019, Privacy One Group, owned by adtech company System1, acquired a majority stake in Startpage. An initial lack of transparency surrounding the deal caused some concern among privacy researchers, leading to its removal from the PrivacyTools review website.[19][20] After responding to questions from PrivacyTools team members, Startpage was able to clarify that the acquisition would not impact their privacy-focused mission, and its recommendation was ultimately restored.[21][22] According to the company, its \"founders may unilaterally reject any potential technical change that could negatively affect user privacy\".[23][24] By maintaining its headquarters and operations in the Netherlands, Startpage continues to be protected by Dutch and European Union (EU) privacy laws.[25] In May 2020, Vivaldi announced that its browser had added Startpage as an optional or default search engine.[26][27] Products [edit] On 27 June 2006, following criticism of Google Shopping, the website began to delete private details of its users.[28] Ixquick stated that it does not share the personal information of users with other search engines or with the provider of its sponsored results.[29][30] According to The New York Times\u0027 Wirecutter, Startpage does not store user\u0027s personal information or search data.[31] A May 2020 review of the website on ZDNet also states that Startpage \"does not track, log, or share data or searching history\".[32] In 2011, Startpage received the European Privacy Seal, a European Union–sponsored initiative that indicates compliance with EU laws and regulations on data security and privacy through a series of design and technical audits. It was re-certified in 2013 and 2015.[33] The company has also completely ended the recording of user IP addresses since January 2009.[34] Because Startpage is based in the Netherlands, it is also \"not subject to US laws like the Patriot Act, and cannot be forced to comply with US dragnet surveillance programs, like PRISM.\"[35] Startpage has also contributed €20,000 to NOYB, the non-profit organization founded by Max Schrems, which is committed to launching strategic court cases and media initiatives in support of the EU\u0027s General Data Protection Regulation.[32] The company also provides a stand-alone proxy service, Startpage.com Proxy, which is incorporated into the Startpage search engine.[36] This feature, known as Anonymous View since 2018, allows users the option to open all search res",

This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called \"hard news\" to differentiate it from soft media. Subject matters for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, economy, business, fashion, sport, entertainment, and the environment, as well as quirky or unusual events. Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. Throughout history, people have transported new information through oral means. Having developed in China over centuries, newspapers became established in Europe during the early modern period. In the 20th century, radio and television became an important means of transmitting news. Whilst in the 21st century, the internet has also begun to play a similar role. Meaning [edit] Etymology [edit] The English word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In Middle English, the equivalent word was newes, like the French nouvelles. Similar developments are found in the Slavic languages – namely cognates from Serbo-Croatian novost (from nov, \"new\"), Czech and Slovak noviny (from nový, \"new\"), the Polish nowiny (pronounced noviney), the Bulgarian novini and Russian novosti – and likewise in the Celtic languages: the Welsh newyddion (from newydd) and the Cornish nowodhow (from nowydh).[1][2] Jessica Garretson Finch is credited with coining the phrase \"current events\" while teaching at Barnard College in the 1890s.[3] Newness [edit] As its name implies, \"news\" typically connotes the presentation of new information.[4][5] The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.[5][6][7] Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.[8] News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even",

(June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

Collaboration partners do so by providing query terms, collective tagging, adding comments or opinions, rating search results, and links clicked of former (successful) IR activities to users having the same or a related information need. Models of collaboration [edit] Collaborative search engines can be classified along several dimensions: intent (explicit and implicit) and synchronization,[1] depth of mediation,[2] task vs. trait,[3] division of labor, and sharing of knowledge.[4] Explicit vs. implicit collaboration [edit] Implicit collaboration characterizes Collaborative filtering and recommendation systems in which the system infers similar information needs. I-Spy,[5] Jumper 2.0, Seeks, the Community Search Assistant,[6] the CSE of Burghardt et al.,[7] and the works of Longo et al. [8] [9] [10] all represent examples of implicit collaboration. Systems that fall under this category identify similar users, queries and links clicked automatically, and recommend related queries and links to the searchers. Explicit collaboration means that users share an agreed-upon information need and work together toward that goal. For example, in a chat-like application, query terms and links clicked are automatically exchanged. The most prominent example of this class is SearchTogether[11] published in 2007. SearchTogether offers an interface that combines search results from standard search engines and a chat to exchange queries and links. PlayByPlay[12] takes a step further to support general purpose collaborative browsing tasks with an instant messaging functionality. Reddy et al.[13] follow a similar approach and compares two implementations of their CSE called MUSE and MUST. Reddy et al. focus on the role of communication required for efficient CSEs. Cerciamo [2] supports explicit collaboration by allowing one person to concentrate on finding promising groups of documents while having the other person make in-depth judgments of relevance on documents found by the first person. However, in Papagelis et al.[14] terms are used differently: they combine explicitly shared links and implicitly collected browsing histories of users to a hybrid CSE. Community of practice [edit] Recent work in collaborative filtering and information retrieval has shown that sharing of search experiences among users having similar interests, typically called a community of practice or community of interest, reduces the effort put in by a given user in retrieving the exact information of interest.[15] Collaborative search deployed within a community of practice deploys novel techniques for exploiting context during search by indexing and ranking search results based on the learned preferences of a community of users.[16] The users benefit by sharing information, experiences and awareness to personalize result-lists to reflect the preferences of the community as a whole. The community representing a group of users who share common interests, similar professions. The best known example is the open-source project ApexKB (previously known as Jumper 2.0).[17] Depth of mediation [edit] The depth of mediation refers to the degree that the CSE mediates search.[2] SearchTogether[11] is an example of UI-level mediation: users exchange query results and judgments of relevance, but the system does not distinguish among users when they run queries. PlayByPlay[12] is another example of UI-level mediation where all users have full and equal access to the instant messaging functionality without the system\u0027s coordination. Cerchiamo[2] and recommendation systems such as I-Spy[5] keep track of each person\u0027s search activity independently and use that information to affect their search results. These are examples of deeper algorithmic mediation. Task vs. trait [edit] This model classifies people\u0027s membership in groups based on the task at hand vs. long-term interests; these may be correlated with explicit and implicit collaboration.[3] Platforms and modalities [edit] CSE systems started off on the desktop end, with the earliest ones being extensions or modifications to existing web",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from KidzSearch) Google search feature The filter for SafeSearch on Google. SafeSearch is a search feature on Google, and later, Microsoft Bing.[1] It is an automated filter of pornography, violence, gore, and other offensive or inappropriate content.[2] It is used as a parental control setting due to the feature being, most likely, to keep children from harmful content. History [edit] On November 11th, 2009, Google introduced the ability for users with Google Accounts to lock on the SafeSearch level in Google\u0027s web and image searches. Once configured, a password is required to change the setting.[3] On December 12, 2012, Google removed the option to turn off the filter entirely, requiring users to enter more specific search queries to access adult content.[4][5][6] SafeSearch can be enforced by local area network administrators and ISPs by adding a DNS record. This is often done on school networks to prevent students from accessing pornographic content.[7][8] Users themselves can turn this setting on to filter out any inappropriate content.[9] Effectiveness [edit] A report by Harvard Law School\u0027s Berkman Center for Internet \u0026 Society stated that SafeSearch excluded many innocuous websites from search-result listings, including ones created by the White House, IBM, the American Library Association and Liz Claiborne.[10] On the other hand, many pornographic images slip through the filter, even when \"innocent\" search terms are entered. Blacklisting certain search terms is hindered by homographs (e.g., \"beaver\"),[11] blacklisting certain URLs is rendered ineffective by the changing URLs of porn sites, and software to tag images with copious amounts of flesh tones as pornographic content is problematic because there are a variety of skin tones and pictures of babies tend to have a lot of flesh tones.[12] Google\u0027s ability to filter porn has been an important factor in its relationship with the People\u0027s Republic of China.[13] References [edit] ^ \"Enforcing Bing SafeSearch | Tech Lockdown\". www.techlockdown.com.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Cache of web pages The link for the cached version of a web page in search results from Google (top), Bing (middle) and Yandex (bottom) A search engine cache is a cache of web pages that shows the page as it was when it was indexed by a web crawler. Cached versions of web pages can be used to view the contents of a page when the live version cannot be reached, has been altered or taken down.[1] A web crawler collects the contents of a web page, which is then indexed by a web search engine. The search engine might make the copy accessible to users. Web crawlers that obey restrictions in robots.txt[2] or meta tags[3] by the site webmaster may not make a cached copy available to search engine users if instructed not to. Search engine caches can be used for crime investigation,[4] legal proceedings[5] and journalism.[6][1] They may not be fully protected by the usual laws that protect technology providers from copyright infringement claims.[7] Google Cache [edit] Google retired its web caching service in 2024.[8] The service was designed for websites that might show up in a Google search result, but are temporarily offline. As a \"cache\", it was not designed for archival purposes, the cache had expiration. Google said the Internet as of 2024 is much more reliable than it was \"way back\" in earlier days, and therefore its cache service is no longer an important service to maintain.[8] Google pointed to the Wayback Machine as a better alternative, and suggested Google might work with them in the future.[8] In September 2024, Google and the Internet Archive announced a collaboration providing links to the Wayback Machine from within Google Search.[9] Bing Search [edit] Bing Search, following Google Cache\u0027s lead, also retired its web caching service in late 2024. Microsoft explained, \"the internet has evolved for better reliability, and many pages aren\u0027t optimized for cache viewing.\"[10][11] Yahoo! Search [edit] Yahoo! Search began offering a cache service in May 2011.[12] After Google Cache was eliminated in early 2024, PC Mag reported that alternative sites Bing and Yahoo! Search were still available for caching. It noted that as long as Bing cache worked, Yahoo! Search would also, since Microsoft (Bing) is the crawling service for Yahoo. Bing cache ceased working late in 2024, and Yahoo Cache buttons are no longer available. There was no official announcement from Yahoo about the cache service being eliminated.[13] References [edit] ^ a b Wilfried Ruetten (2012). The Data Journalism Handbook. O\u0027Reilly Media, Inc.

Please refer to the current edition of the \"Internet\n   Official Protocol Standards\" (STD 1) for the standardization state\n   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n\nCopyright Notice\n\n   Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2004).\n\nAbstract\n\n   This document updates the specification of the WHOIS protocol,\n   thereby obsoleting RFC 954.  The update is intended to remove the\n   material from RFC 954 that does not have to do with the on-the-wire\n   protocol, and is no longer applicable in today\u0027s Internet.  This\n   document does not attempt to change or update the protocol per se, or\n   document other uses of the protocol that have come into existence\n   since the publication of RFC 954.\n\n1.  Introduction\n\n   WHOIS is a TCP-based transaction-oriented query/response protocol\n   that is widely used to provide information services to Internet\n   users.  While originally used to provide \"white pages\" services and\n   information about registered domain names, current deployments cover\n   a much broader range of information services.  The protocol delivers\n   its content in a human-readable format.  This document updates the\n   specification of the WHOIS protocol, thereby obsoleting RFC 954 [1].\n\n   For historic reasons, WHOIS lacks many of the protocol design\n   attributes, for example internationalisation and strong security,\n   that would be expected from any recently-designed IETF protocol.\n   This document does not attempt to rectify any of those shortcomings.\n   Instead, this memo documents the WHOIS protocol as it is.  In some\n   areas, this document does document particular well known shortcomings\n   of the WHOIS protocol.  The discussion of possible protocols to carry\n   out these functions, with updated capabilities to address the\n\n\n\nDaigle                      Standards Track                     [Page 1] \nRFC 3912              WHOIS Protocol Specification        September 2004\n\n\n   shortcomings, is being addressed in a separate IETF activity (CRISP\n   Working Group).\n\n2.  Protocol Specification\n\n   A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for requests from WHOIS\n   clients.  The WHOIS client makes a text request to the WHOIS server,\n   then the WHOIS server replies with text content.  All requests are\n   terminated with ASCII CR and then ASCII LF.  The response might\n   contain more than one line of text, so the presence of ASCII CR or\n   ASCII LF characters does not indicate the end of the response.  The\n   WHOIS server closes its connection as soon as the output is finished.\n   The closed TCP connection is the indication to the client that the\n   response has been received.\n\n3.  Protocol Example\n\n   If one places a request of the WHOIS server located at whois.nic.mil\n   for information about \"Smith\", the packets on the wire will look\n   like:\n\n   client                           server at whois.nic.mil\n\n   open TCP   ---- (SYN) ------------------------------\u003e\n              \u003c---- (SYN+ACK) -------------------------\n   send query ---- \"Smith\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e\" --------------------\u003e\n   get answer \u003c---- \"Info about Smith\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e\" ---------\n              \u003c---- \"More info about Smith\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e\" ----\n   close      \u003c---- (FIN) ------------------------------\n              ----- (FIN) -----------------------------\u003e\n\n4.  Internationalisation\n\n   The WHOIS protocol has not been internationalised.  The WHOIS\n   protocol has no mechanism for indicating the character set in use.\n   Originally, the predominant text encoding in use was US-ASCII.  In\n   practice, some WHOIS servers, particularly those outside the USA,\n   might be using some other character set either for requests, replies,\n   or both.  This inability to predict or express text encoding has\n   adversely impacted the interoperability (and, therefore, usefulness)\n   of the WHOIS protocol.\n\n5.  Security Considerations\n\n   The WHOIS protocol has no provisions for strong security.  WHOIS\n   lacks mechanisms for access control, integrity, and confidentiality.\n   Accordingly, WHOIS-based services should only be used for information\n   which is non-sensitive and intended to be accessible to everyone.\n\n\n\nDaigle                      Standards Track                     [Page 2] \nRFC 3912              WHOIS Protocol Specification        September 2004\n\n\n   The absence of such security mechanisms means this protocol would not\n   normally be acceptable to the IETF at the time of this writing.\n\n6.

Find sources: \"Search engine\" computing – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this message) In computing, a search engine is an information retrieval software system designed to help find information stored on one or more computer systems. Search engines discover, crawl, transform, and store information for retrieval and presentation in response to user queries. The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called hits. The most widely used type of search engine is a web search engine, which searches for information on the World Wide Web. A search engine normally consists of four components, as follows: a search interface, a crawler (also known as a spider or bot), an indexer, and a database. The crawler traverses a document collection, deconstructs document text, and assigns surrogates for storage in the search engine index. Online search engines store images, link data and metadata for the document. How search engines work [edit] Search engines provide an interface to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items. The criteria are referred to as a search query. In the case of text search engines, the search query is typically expressed as a set of words that identify the desired concept that one or more documents may contain.[1] There are several styles of search query syntax that vary in strictness. It can also switch names within the search engines from previous sites. Whereas some text search engines require users to enter two or three words separated by white space, other search engines may enable users to specify entire documents, pictures, sounds, and various forms of natural language. Some search engines apply improvements to search queries to increase the likelihood of providing a quality set of items through a process known as query expansion. Query understanding methods can be used as standardized query language. Index-based search engine The list of items that meet the criteria specified by the query is typically sorted, or ranked. Ranking items by relevance (from highest to lowest) reduces the time required to find the desired information. Probabilistic search engines rank items based on measures of similarity (between each item and the query, typically on a scale of 1 to 0, 1 being most similar) and sometimes popularity or authority (see Bibliometrics) or use relevance feedback. Boolean search engines typically only return items which match exactly without regard to order, although the term Boolean search engine may simply refer to the use of Boolean-style syntax (the use of operators AND, OR, NOT, and XOR) in a probabilistic context. To provide a set of matching items that are sorted according to some criteria quickly, a search engine will typically collect metadata about the group of items under consideration beforehand through a process referred to as indexing. The index typically requires a smaller amount of computer storage, which is why some search engines only store the indexed information and not the full content of each item, and instead provide a method of navigating to the items in the search engine result page. Alternatively, the search engine may store a copy of each item in a cache so that users can see the state of the item at the time it was indexed or for archive purposes or to make repetitive processes work more efficiently and quickly.[2] Other types of search engines do not store an index. Crawler, or spider type search engines (a.k.a. real-time search engines) may collect and assess items at the time of the search query, dynamically considering additional items based on the contents of a starting item (known as a seed, or seed URL in the case of an Internet crawler).

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science. In response to American industrialization, William Barton Rogers organized a school in Boston to create \"useful knowledge.\" Initially funded by a federal land grant, the institute adopted a polytechnic model that stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT moved from Boston to Cambridge in 1916 and grew rapidly through collaboration with private industry, military branches, and new federal basic research agencies, the formation of which was influenced by MIT faculty like Vannevar Bush. In the late twentieth century, MIT became a leading center for research in computer science, digital technology, artificial intelligence and big science initiatives like the Human Genome Project. Engineering remains its largest school, though MIT has also built programs in basic science, social sciences, business management, and humanities. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) along the Charles River. The campus is known for academic buildings interconnected by corridors and many significant modernist buildings. MIT\u0027s off-campus operations include the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes. The institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies.[10][11] As of October 2024[update], 105 Nobel laureates,[12] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[13] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[14] 83 Marshall Scholars,[15] 41 astronauts,[16] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and 8 foreign heads of state have been affiliated with MIT. History [edit] Main article: History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Foundation and vision [edit] [...] a school of industrial science aiding the advancement, development and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce [...][17] — Massachusetts General Court, Acts of 1861, Chapter 183 In 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a \"Conservatory of Art and Science\", but the proposal failed.[18][19] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.[20] Rogers, a geologist who had recently arrived in Boston from the University of Virginia,[21] wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.[22][23] He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education,[24] proposing that: The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.[25] The Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.[26][27] Early developments [edit] Original Rog",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Investigative data-analysis technique See also: Open-source intelligence In network theory, link analysis is a data-analysis technique used to evaluate relationships between nodes. Relationships may be identified among various types of nodes, including organizations, people and transactions. Link analysis has been used for investigation of criminal activity (fraud, counterterrorism, and intelligence), computer security analysis, search engine optimization, market research, medical research, and art. Knowledge discovery [edit] Knowledge discovery is an iterative and interactive process used to identify, analyze and visualize patterns in data.[1] Network analysis, link analysis and social network analysis are all methods of knowledge discovery, each a corresponding subset of the prior method. Most knowledge discovery methods follow these steps (at the highest level):[2] Data processing Transformation Analysis Visualization Data gathering and processing requires access to data and has several inherent issues, including information overload and data errors. Once data is collected, it will need to be transformed into a format that can be effectively used by both human and computer analyzers. Manual or computer-generated visualizations tools may be mapped from the data, including network charts. Several algorithms exist to help with analysis of data – Dijkstra\u0027s algorithm, breadth-first search, and depth-first search. Link analysis focuses on analysis of relationships among nodes through visualization methods (network charts, association matrix). Here is an example of the relationships that may be mapped for crime investigations:[3] Relationship/Network Data Sources 1. Trust Prior contacts in family, neighborhood, school, military, club or organization. Public and court records. Data may only be available in suspect\u0027s native country. 2. Task Logs and records of phone calls, electronic mail, chat rooms, instant messages, Web site visits. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. 3. Money \u0026 Resources Bank account and money transfer records. Pattern and location of credit card use. Prior court records. Human intelligence: observation of visits to alternate banking resources such as Hawala. 4. Strategy \u0026 Goals Web sites. Videos and encrypted disks delivered by courier. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. Link analysis is used for 3 primary purposes:[4] Find matches in data for known patterns of interest; Find anomalies where known patterns are violated; Discover new patterns of interest (social network analysis, data mining). History [edit] Klerks categorized link analysis tools into 3 generations.[5] The first generation was introduced in 1975 as the Anacpapa Chart of Harper and Harris.[6] This method requires that a domain expert review data files, identify associations by constructing an association matrix, create a link chart for visualization and finally analyze the network chart to identify patterns of interest. This method requires extensive domain knowledge and is extremely time-consuming when reviewing vast amounts of data. Association Matrix In addition to the association matrix, the activities matrix can be used to produce actionable information, which has practical value and use to law-enforcement. The activities matrix, as the term might imply, centers on the actions and activities of people with respect to locations. Whereas the association matrix focuses on the relationships between people, organizations, and/or properties. The distinction between these two types of matrices, while minor, is nonetheless significant in terms of the output of the analysis completed or rendered.[7][8][9][10] Second generation tools consist of automatic graphics-based analysis tools such as IBM i2 Analyst\u0027s Notebook, Netmap, ClueMaker and Watson. These tools offer the ability to automate the construction and updates of the link chart once an association matrix is manually created, however, analysis of the resulting charts and graphs still requires an expert with extensive domain knowledge. The third generation of link-analysis tools like DataWalk allow the automatic visualization of linkages between elements in a data set, that can then serve as the canvas for further exploration or manual updates.

Founded in 1821 by royal charter,[11] the university bears the name of James McGill, a Scottish merchant,[12] whose bequest in 1813 established the University of McGill College. In 1885, the name of the university was officially changed to McGill University. McGill has an enrolment of more than 39,000 students. Its main campus is on the slope of Mount Royal in downtown Montreal in the borough of Ville-Marie, with a second campus situated in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the main campus on Montreal Island. The university is one of two members of the Association of American Universities located outside the United States,[13] alongside the University of Toronto, and is the only Canadian member of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF) within the World Economic Forum.[14] The university offers degrees and diplomas in over 300 fields of study. Most students are enrolled in the six largest faculties: Arts, Science, Medicine, Education, Engineering, and Management.[15] McGill alumni, faculty, and affiliates include 15 Nobel laureates,[16] 149 Rhodes Scholars,[17] 1 Turing Award winner, 3 prime ministers of Canada, 2 governors general of Canada, 9 foreign leaders, and 14 justices of the Supreme Court of Canada. McGill alumni also include 9 Academy Award winners,[note 1] 13 Grammy Award winners,[note 2] 15 Emmy Award winners,[note 3] 4 Pulitzer Prize winners,[note 4] and 121 Olympians with over 35 Olympic medals.[20][ambiguous] History Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning James McGill, the original benefactor of McGill University The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning (RIAL) was created in 1801 under an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (41 George III Chapter 17), An Act for the establishment of Free Schools and the Advancement of Learning in this Province.[21] The RIAL was initially authorized to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This was a turning point for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, which showed the government\u0027s willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first step in the creation of non-denominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813, his bequest was administered by the RIAL. In 1846, the Royal Grammar School in Quebec City closed, and the one in Montreal merged with the High School of Montreal. By the mid-19th century, the RIAL had lost control of the other eighty-two grammar schools it had administered.[22] However, in 1853 it took over the High School of Montreal from the school\u0027s board of directors and continued to operate it until 1870.[23][24] Thereafter, its sole remaining purpose was to administer the McGill bequest on behalf of the private college. The RIAL continues to exist today; it is the corporate identity that runs the university and its various constituent bodies, including the former Macdonald College (now Macdonald Campus), the Montreal Neurological Institute, and the Royal Victoria College (the former women\u0027s college turned residence). Since the revised Royal Charter of 1852, the trustees of the RIAL are the board of governors of McGill University.[11] McGill College The first Principal of McGill College, The Rt. Rev.

    "content": "Web Data Mining Exploring Hyperlinks, Contents, and Usage Data Bing Liu, Second Edition, July 2011 First Edition, Dec 2006, Springer Second Edition First Edition Web mining aims to discover useful knowledge from Web hyperlinks, page content and usage log. Based on the primary kind of data used in the mining process, Web mining tasks are categorized into three main types: Web structure mining, Web content mining and Web usage mining. This book consists of two parts. The first part covers the data mining and machine learning foundations, where all the essential algorithms of data mining and machine learning are presented. The second part covers the key topics of Web mining, where Web crawling, search, social network analysis, structured data extraction, information integration, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, Web usage mining, query log mining, computational advertising, and recommender systems are all treated in breadth and in depth (the SVD matrix factorization algorithm of Simon Funk used in Netflix Prize Contest is described in detail). What is new in the second edition? Most chapters have been updated. The major changes are in Chapter 11 and Chapter 12, which have been re-written and significantly expanded. When the first edition was written, opinion mining (Chapter 11) was still in its infancy. Since then, the research community has proposed many novel techniques to solve various aspects of the problem. To include the latest developments for the Web usage mining chapter (Chapter 12), the topics of recommender systems and collaborative filtering, query log mining, and computational advertising have been added. This new edition is thus considerably longer, from a total of 532 pages in the first edition to a total of 622 pages in this second edition. Teaching and Learning: Although the book is titled \"Web Data Mining\", it also covers the key topics of data mining, information retrieval, and text mining. Thus, it is suitable for a data mining course, in which the students learn not only data mining, but also Web mining and text mining. The book is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers and practioners in the field. No prior knowledge of data mining or machine learning is assumed.

The service traces its roots back to Microsoft\u0027s earlier search engines, including MSN Search, Windows Live Search, and Live Search. Bing offers a broad spectrum of search services, encompassing web, video, image, and map search products, all developed using ASP.NET. The transition from Live Search to Bing was announced by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California. The official release followed on June 3, 2009. Bing introduced several notable features at its inception, such as search suggestions during query input and a list of related searches, known as the \u0027Explore pane\u0027. These features leveraged semantic technology from Powerset, a company Microsoft acquired in 2008. Microsoft also struck a deal with Yahoo! that led to Bing powering Yahoo! Search. Microsoft made significant strides towards open-source technology in 2016, making the BitFunnel search engine indexing algorithm and various components of Bing open source. In February 2023, Microsoft launched Bing Chat (later renamed Microsoft Copilot), an artificial intelligence chatbot experience based on GPT-4, integrated directly into the search engine. This was well-received, with Bing reaching 100 million active users by the following month. As of April 2024, Bing holds the position of the second-largest search engine worldwide, with a market share of 3.64%, behind Google\u0027s 90.91%. Other competitors include Yandex with 1.61%, Baidu with 1.15%, and Yahoo!, which is largely powered by Bing, with 1.13%.[6] Approximately 27.43% of Bing\u0027s monthly global traffic comes from China, 22.16% from the United States, 4.85% from Japan, 4.18% from Germany and 3.61% from France.[7] History Background (1998–2009) MSN Search MSN Search homepage in 2002 MSN Search homepage in 2006 Microsoft launched MSN Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from Inktomi. It consisted of a search engine, index, and web crawler. In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version which displayed listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instead. Microsoft decided to make a large investment in web search by building its own web crawler for MSN Search, the index of which was updated weekly and sometimes daily. The upgrade started as a beta program in November 2004, and came out of beta in February 2005.[8] This occurred a year after rival Yahoo! Search rolled out its own crawler. Image search was powered by a third party, Picsearch. The service also started providing its search results to other search engine portals in an effort to better compete in the market. Windows Live Search Windows Live Search homepage The first public beta of Windows Live Search was unveiled on March 8, 2006, with the final release on September 11, 2006 replacing MSN Search. The new search engine used search tabs that include Web, news, images, music, desktop, local, and Microsoft Encarta. In the roll-over from MSN Search to Windows Live Search, Microsoft stopped using Picsearch as their image search provider and started performing their own image search, fueled by their own internal image search algorithms.[9] Live Search Live Search homepage, which would help to create the Bing homepage later on On March 21, 2007, Microsoft announced that it would separate its search developments from the Windows Live services family, rebranding the service as Live Search. Live Search was integrated into the Live Search and Ad Platform headed by Satya Nadella, part of Microsoft\u0027s Platform and Systems division. As part of this change, Live Search was merged with Microsoft adCenter.[10] A series of reorganizations and consolidations of Microsoft\u0027s search offerings were made under the Live Search brandi",

    "title": "Privacy concerns with Google - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Scroogle) Privacy concerns with Google include a wide range of issues and controversies related to collection, use, and sharing of user data across Google products, services, and platforms, including Google Search. Since the mid-2000s, civil liberties organizations and government regulators have criticized and taken action against Google related to Internet privacy issues in its data collection and data retention policies, web tracking practices, cooperation with intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies, and other activities. These concerns are a frequent theme in criticism of Google. History [edit] In 2007, Privacy International raised concerns regarding the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of Internet users\u0027 searches, and how under controversial existing U.S. law, Google can be forced to hand over all such information to the U.S. government.[1] In its 2007 Consultation Report, Privacy International ranked Google as \"Hostile to Privacy\", its lowest rating on their report, making Google the only company in the list to receive that ranking.[1][2][3] Around December 2009, after privacy concerns were raised, Google\u0027s CEO Eric Schmidt declared: \"If you have something that you don\u0027t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn\u0027t be doing it in the first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines—including Google—do retain this information for some time and it\u0027s important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.\"[4] At the Techonomy conference in 2010, Eric Schmidt predicted that \"true transparency and no anonymity\" is the path to take for the Internet: \"In a world of asynchronous threats it is too dangerous for there not to be some way to identify you.

Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don\u0027t have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You\u0027ve got Facebook photos!\"[5] Google\u0027s changes to its privacy policy on March 16, 2012, enabled the company to share data across a wide variety of services.[6] These embedded services include millions of third-party websites that use AdSense and Analytics. The policy was widely criticized for creating an environment that discourages Internet innovation by making Internet users more fearful and wary of what they do online.[7] In the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google\u0027s privacy policy was changed to state it \"may\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the \"Activity controls\" in the \"My Account\" page of a Google account. ProPublica stated that \"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\" Google contacted ProPublica to correct the fact that it didn\u0027t \"currently\" use Gmail keywords to target web ads.[8] Shona Ghosh, a journalist for Business Insider, noted in 2019 that an increasing digital resistance movement against Google had grown.[9] A major hub for critics of Google in order to organize to abstain from using Google products is the Reddit page for the subreddit r/degoogle.[9] The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit organization which deals with civil liberties, raised concerns in 2018 regarding privacy issues pertaining to student data after conducting a survey which showed that a majority of parents, students and teachers are concerned that student privacy is being breached.[10] According to the EFF, the Federal Trade Commission has ignored complaints from the public that Google has been harvesting student data and search results even after holding talks with the Department of Education in 2018.[10][4] In 2019, Google blocked W3C privacy proposals using their veto power.[11] The W3C decides how the World Wide Web works, and Google vetoed a measure to expand W3C\u0027s power within its internet privacy group.[12] Potential for data disclosure [edit] Data leaks [edit] On March 10, 2009, Google reported that a bug in Google Docs had allowed unintended",

The service traces its roots back to Microsoft\u0027s earlier search engines, including MSN Search, Windows Live Search, and Live Search. Bing offers a broad spectrum of search services, encompassing web, video, image, and map search products, all developed using ASP.NET. The transition from Live Search to Bing was announced by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California. The official release followed on June 3, 2009. Bing introduced several notable features at its inception, such as search suggestions during query input and a list of related searches, known as the \u0027Explore pane\u0027. These features leveraged semantic technology from Powerset, a company Microsoft acquired in 2008. Microsoft also struck a deal with Yahoo! that led to Bing powering Yahoo! Search. Microsoft made significant strides towards open-source technology in 2016, making the BitFunnel search engine indexing algorithm and various components of Bing open source. In February 2023, Microsoft launched Bing Chat (later renamed Microsoft Copilot), an artificial intelligence chatbot experience based on GPT-4, integrated directly into the search engine. This was well-received, with Bing reaching 100 million active users by the following month. As of April 2024, Bing holds the position of the second-largest search engine worldwide, with a market share of 3.64%, behind Google\u0027s 90.91%. Other competitors include Yandex with 1.61%, Baidu with 1.15%, and Yahoo!, which is largely powered by Bing, with 1.13%.[6] Approximately 27.43% of Bing\u0027s monthly global traffic comes from China, 22.16% from the United States, 4.85% from Japan, 4.18% from Germany and 3.61% from France.[7] History Background (1998–2009) MSN Search MSN Search homepage in 2002 MSN Search homepage in 2006 Microsoft launched MSN Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from Inktomi. It consisted of a search engine, index, and web crawler. In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version which displayed listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instead. Microsoft decided to make a large investment in web search by building its own web crawler for MSN Search, the index of which was updated weekly and sometimes daily. The upgrade started as a beta program in November 2004, and came out of beta in February 2005.[8] This occurred a year after rival Yahoo! Search rolled out its own crawler. Image search was powered by a third party, Picsearch. The service also started providing its search results to other search engine portals in an effort to better compete in the market. Windows Live Search Windows Live Search homepage The first public beta of Windows Live Search was unveiled on March 8, 2006, with the final release on September 11, 2006 replacing MSN Search. The new search engine used search tabs that include Web, news, images, music, desktop, local, and Microsoft Encarta. In the roll-over from MSN Search to Windows Live Search, Microsoft stopped using Picsearch as their image search provider and started performing their own image search, fueled by their own internal image search algorithms.[9] Live Search Live Search homepage, which would help to create the Bing homepage later on On March 21, 2007, Microsoft announced that it would separate its search developments from the Windows Live services family, rebranding the service as Live Search. Live Search was integrated into the Live Search and Ad Platform headed by Satya Nadella, part of Microsoft\u0027s Platform and Systems division. As part of this change, Live Search was merged with Microsoft adCenter.[10] A series of reorganizations and consolidations of Microsoft\u0027s search offerings were made under the Live Search brandin",

For the subfield of computer science, see Analysis of algorithms. For other uses, see Algorithm (disambiguation). Flowchart of using successive subtractions to find the greatest common divisor of number r and s In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ⓘ) is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1] Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning). In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results.[2] For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called \"algorithms\", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly \"correct\" recommendation. As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[3] and in a well-defined formal language[4] for calculating a function.[5] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[6] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[7] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\"[8] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[9] Etymology [edit] Around 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī wrote kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī (\"Book of Indian computation\") and kitab al-jam\u0027 wa\u0027l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī (\"Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic\"). In the early 12th century, Latin translations of these texts involving the Hindu–Arabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared, for example Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice, attributed to John of Seville, and Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum, attributed to Adelard of Bath.[10] Here, alghoarismi or algorismi is the Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi\u0027s name;[1] the text starts with the phrase Dixit Algorismi, or \"Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi\".[2] The word algorism in English came to mean the use of place-value notation in calculations; it occurs in the Ancrene Wisse from circa 1225.[11] By the time Geoffrey Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century, he used a variant of the same word in describing augrym stones, stones used for place-value calculation.[12][13] In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός (arithmos, \"number\"; cf. \"arithmetic\"), the Latin word was altered to algorithmus.[14] By 1596, this form of the word was used in English, as algorithm, by Thomas Hood.[15] Definition [edit] For a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of \"algorithm\", see Algorithm characterizations. One informal definition is \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\",[16] which would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure[17] or cook-book recipe.[18] In general, a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventually[19]—even though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable. Boolos, Jeffrey \u0026 1974, 1999 define an algorithm to be an explicit set of instructions for determining an output, that can be followed by a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols.[20] Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain performing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or a mechanical device. History [edit] This section is missing information about 20th and 21st century development of computer algorithms. Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (October 2023) Ancient algorithms [edit] Step-by-step procedures for solving mathematical problems have been recorded since antiquity. This includes in Babylonian mathematics (around 2500 BC),[21] Egyptian mathematics (around 1550 BC),[21] Indian mathematics (around 800 BC and later),[22][23] the Ifa Oracle (around 500 BC),[24] Greek mathematics (around 240 BC),[25] Chinese mathematics (around 200 BC and later),[26] and Arabic mathematics (around 800 AD).[27] The earliest evidence of algorithms is found in ancient Mesopotamian mathematics. A Sumerian clay tablet found in Shuruppak near Baghdad and dated to c. 2500 BC describes the earliest division algorithm.[21] During the Hammurabi dynasty c. 18",

Alan Emtage invented the world\u0027s first search engine, but he didn\u0027t earn a single cent from his groundbreaking invention. \"I wrote a piece of code that gave birth to a multibillion-dollar industry,\" he tells The Huffington Post in an exclusive video interview. \"I didn\u0027t make any money off of it, but I wouldn\u0027t change anything.\" The self-proclaimed geek majored in computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and was working as a systems administrator for the School of Computer Science, where he was responsible for finding software for students and faculty. At the time, there was no other way to locate the software beyond a manual search through the directory archives, a \"tedious process\" that he decided to automate. Advertisement \"We built this very simple program that allowed people to do the search themselves,\" the native of Barbados says. The program needed a name, so Emtage called it \"Archie,\" which is \"archive\" without the V. Within months, half the internet traffic to Canada was going to the innovator\u0027s machine. \"At the time, nobody was making money off of the Internet, and we didn\u0027t patent any of the original ideas behind Archie,\" he explains. \"So the patents would have been where I would have made the money.\" Archie used the same techniques that every current search engine uses, so, Emtage adds, \"in that way, Archie was the great great grandfather of Google and all of those other search engines.\" Today, the Search industry earns $780 billion dollars annually. Emtage sees none of that money, but he is completely at ease with it. \"I don\u0027t feel like a father of anything,\" he states. \"It\u0027s not how I think of myself really ...

PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.[13] It is supported on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses, data lakes,[14] or web services with many concurrent users. The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components. This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor. These include special-purpose database engine features, like those needed to support a geospatial[15] or temporal[16] database or features which emulate other database products.[17][18][19][20] Also available from third parties are a wide variety of user and machine interface features, such as graphical user interfaces[21][22][23] or load balancing and high availability toolsets.[24] The large third-party PostgreSQL support network of people, companies, products, and projects, even though not part of The PostgreSQL Development Group, are essential to the PostgreSQL database engine\u0027s adoption and use and make up the PostgreSQL ecosystem writ large.[25] PostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.[26][27] In 1996, the project was renamed PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.[28] History [edit] Ingres and University POSTGRES (1982–1994) [edit] PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, Michael Stonebraker, left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.[26] He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the Turing Award in 2014 for these and other projects,[29] and techniques pioneered in them. The new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types.[30] These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships – something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.[31] Starting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM SIGMOD Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers[32] and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2[33] on June 30, 1994 – primarily a cleanup – the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter, which could be interactively used with a console application named monitor. Postgres95 (1994–1996) [edit] In 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. The monitor console was also replaced by psql. Yu a",

It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.[19] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022[update] according to GitHub.[20] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[21] Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun\u0027s Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle, which bought Sun in 2010, offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM, which is open-source software used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. Java 25 is the version current as of September 2025[update]. Java 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25 are long-term support versions still under maintenance. History See also: Java (software platform) § History Duke, the Java mascot James Gosling, the creator of Java, in 2008 James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[22] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[23] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling\u0027s office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[24] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[25] Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[26] It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[27] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively. In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[28][29][30] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[31] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementatio",

For instances of the general concept, see Lists of databases. An SQL select statement and its result In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a database management system (DBMS), the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term \"database\" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. Before digital storage and retrieval of data have become widespread, index cards were used for data storage in a wide range of applications and environments: in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes in a card file. Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes until they were replaced by indexing software in the 1980s and 1990s. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance. Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages. Terminology and overview Formally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data accessed through the use of a \"database management system\" (DBMS), which is an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized. Because of the close relationship between them, the term \"database\" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it. Outside the world of professional information technology, the term database is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.[1] Existing DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups: Data definition – Creation, modification and removal of definitions that detail how the data is to be organized. Update – Insertion, modification, and deletion of the data itself.[2] Retrieval – Selecting data according to specified criteria (e.g., a query, a position in a hierarchy, or a position in relation to other data) and providing that data either directly to the user, or making it available for further processing by the database itself or by other applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a more or less direct form without modification, as it is stored in the database, or in a new form obtained by altering it or combining it with existing data from the database.[3] Administration – Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.[4] Both a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular database model.[5] \"Database system\" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.[6] Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable storage. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large-volume t",

For websites that scrape content, see Scraper site. This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"Web scraping\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (April 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.[1] Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis. Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping). As well as contact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup, and web data integration. Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include market research, price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data. Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server. There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing. History [edit] After the birth of the World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[2] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web. In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, Jump Station was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot. In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public.[3] Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.

The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images.

This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

He is the co-founder and former CEO of Yahoo! Inc. and founding partner of AME Cloud Ventures.[1][2] As of May 2025,[update] Yang has a net worth of $3.1 billion.[3] Early life and education [edit] Yang was born Yang Chih-Yuan in Taipei, Taiwan, on November 6, 1968.[2] His mother was a professor of English and drama and his father died when he was two. Yang has a younger brother, Chih-Kong Ken Yang.[4][5] In 1978, his mother moved the family to San Jose, California, where his grandmother and extended family took care of the boys while his mother taught English to other immigrants.[4][6][7] After moving to the US, Yang took the American name Jerry; his mother, Lily; and his younger brother, Ken.[8] He says that he only knew one English word, \"shoe\", when he came to America, but became fluent in English in about three years.[9] During his time at San Jose, Yang attended Ruskin Elementary School, Sierramont Middle, and Piedmont Hills High School. He graduated from Piedmont Hills High School and went on to earn both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in electrical engineering from Stanford University in four years.[9] He met David Filo at Stanford in 1989, and the two went to Japan in 1992 for a six-month exchange program, where he met his future wife, Akiko Yamazaki, also participating in the exchange program.[9] Career [edit] Yang founded Yahoo! in 1994 and was CEO from 2007 to 2009. He left Yahoo! in 2012. He founded a venture capital firm called AME Cloud Ventures and, as of 2015, is on several corporate boards. According to Rob Solomon, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners, Yang was \"a great founder, evangelist, strategist and mentor,\" having \"created the blueprint for what is possible on the Internet.\"[10] 1994–2012: Yahoo! years [edit] While studying at Stanford in 1994, Yang and David Filo co-created an Internet website called \"Jerry and David\u0027s Guide to the World Wide Web,\" which consisted of a directory of other websites. As it grew in popularity they renamed it \"Yahoo! Inc.\" Yahoo! received around 100,000 unique visitors by the fall of 1994. In April 1995, Yahoo! received a $2 million investment from Sequoia Capital, Tim Koogle was hired as CEO, and Yang and Filo were each appointed \"Chief Yahoo.\" Yahoo! received a second round of funding in the Fall of 1995 from Reuters and Softbank. It went public in April 1996 with 49 employees.[4][11][12] In 1999, Yang was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[3][13] Terry Semel, who replaced Tim Koogle as CEO after the dot-com bubble crash, was CEO until 2007 when the rise of Google led the board to fire him and appoint Yang as interim CEO.[4] Alibaba [edit] Yang met Alibaba founder Jack Ma in 1997 during Yang\u0027s first trip to China. Ma, a government-employed tour guide and former English teacher, gave Yang a tour of the Great Wall of China. The two hit it off and discussed the growth of the Web. Ma created Alibaba several months later. A 1997 photo of Yang and Ma at the Great Wall still hangs on the wall in Alibaba\u0027s Hangzhou office.[4] In 2005, under Yang\u0027s direction but before he took over as CEO in 2007, Yahoo! purchased a 40% stake in Alibaba for $1 billion plus the assets of Yahoo! China, valued at $700 million.[4] In 2012, Yahoo! sold a portion of its stake in Alibaba for $7.6 billion.[14] The company made an additional $9.4 billion in Alibaba\u0027s 2014 IPO.[15] Eric Jackson, the founder of hedge fund Ironfire Capital, called Yahoo!\u0027s investment in Alibaba \"the best investment an American company has ever made in China,\" and stated, \"Jerry deserves enormous credit for that.\"[14] Chinese government controversies [edit] In the fall 2005, a month after the Alibaba investment, news broke that Yahoo! had cooperated with Chinese authorities in the arrest of Chinese journalist Shi Tao in November 2004.[16] Shi had used a Yahoo email address to anonymously notify a pro-democracy website in the US that the Chinese government had ordered the Chinese media not to cover the fifteenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 on June 4.

Types of social media involved include RSS feeds, blogging sites, social bookmarking sites, social news websites, video sharing websites such as YouTube and social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (Twitter). SMO is similar to search engine optimization (SEO) in that the goal is to drive web traffic, and draw attention to a company or creator. SMO\u0027s focal point is on gaining organic links to social media content. In contrast, SEO\u0027s core is about reaching the top of the search engine hierarchy.[1] In general, social media optimization refers to optimizing a website and its content to encourage more users to use and share links to the website across social media and networking sites.[2] SMO is used to strategically create online content ranging from well-written text to eye-catching digital photos or video clips that encourages and entices people to engage with a website. Users share this content, via its weblink, with social media contacts and friends. Common examples of social media engagement are \"liking and commenting on posts, retweeting, embedding, sharing, and promoting content\".[3] Social media optimization is also an effective way of implementing online reputation management (ORM), meaning that if someone posts bad reviews of a business, an SMO strategy can ensure that the negative feedback is not the first link to come up in a list of search engine results.[4] In the 2010s, with social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people, news organizations have become increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating web traffic. Publishers such as The Economist employ large social media teams to optimize their online posts and maximize traffic,[5] while other major publishers now use advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology to generate higher volumes of web traffic.[6] Relationship with search engine optimization The flow and proliferation of content and link shares via social media lead to greater search engine optimization. Social media optimization is an increasingly important factor in search engine optimization, which is the process of designing a website in a way so that it has as high a ranking as possible on search engines. Search engines are increasingly utilizing the recommendations of users of social networks such as Reddit, Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Instagram to rank pages in the search engine result pages.[7] The implication is that when a webpage is shared or \"liked\" by a user on a social network, it counts as a \"vote\" for that webpage\u0027s quality. Thus, search engines can use such votes accordingly to properly ranked websites in search engine results pages. Furthermore, since it is more difficult to tip the scales or influence the search engines in this way, search engines are putting more stock into social search.[7] This, coupled with increasingly personalized search based on interests and location, has significantly increased the importance of a social media presence in search engine optimization. Due to personalized search results, location-based social media presences on websites such as Yelp, Google Places, Foursquare, and Yahoo! Local have become increasingly important. While social media optimization is related to search engine marketing, it differs in several ways. Primarily, SMO focuses on driving web traffic from sources other than search engines, though improved search engine ranking is also a benefit of successful social media optimization. Further, SMO is helpful to target particular geographic regions in order to target and reach potential customers. This helps in lead generation (finding new customers) and contributes to high conversion rates (i.e., converting previously uninterested individuals into people who are interested in a brand or organization). Relationship with viral marketing Social media optimization is in many ways connected to the technique of viral marketing or \"viral seeding\" where word of mouth is created through the use of networking in social bookmarking, video and photo sharing websites. An effective SMO campaign can harness the power of viral marketing; for example, 80% of activity on Pinterest is generated through \"repinning.\"[citation need",

Founded in 1996 by Ivo Lukačovič in Prague as the first web portal in the Czech Republic. Seznam started with a search engine and an internet version of yellow pages. Today, Seznam runs almost 30 different web services and associated brands. Seznam had more than 6 million real users per month at the end of 2014.[4] Among the most popular services, according to NetMonitor, are its homepage seznam.cz, email.cz, search.seznam.cz and its yellow pages firmy.cz.[citation needed] In 2008, Seznam.cz was the most used search engine in the Czech Republic.[5] As of May 2012, according to Toplist results, Seznam was the second internet search engine in the Czech Republic (42.84%) with Google in the top spot (54.69%).[citation needed]. By August 2014, still according to Toplist\u0027s statistics, Seznam\u0027s share of searches had further eroded to 38%. Between 2011 and 2012, Seznam Czech rhyme; Seznam - najdu tam, co hledám (Seznam - I find there, what I search for) as its slogan. Its former (\u0026 current) slogan is Seznam - najdu tam, co neznám (Seznam - I find there, what I don\u0027t know).[6] History [edit] Founded by Ivo Lukačovič in 1996, Seznam began as the first internet yellow pages and search engine in the Czech Republic. Ivo started his business with 50,000 CZK he had saved up. In 1998, Seznam added email to its portfolio, with email accounts running on the @seznam.cz domain. Since then, more brands and services have come on-line. Since 2001, Seznam has included financial, social and political news, TV programs, weather forecasts, dictionaries, maps and community services.[citation needed] In 2000, Spray International, a Swedish web portal company, invested in Seznam. At that time Seznam became a joint stock company. Until 2000, Ivo Lukačovič was self-employed and Seznam was his own sole business. With the investment, it is estimated that Spray International acquired around 30% share of Seznam. Exact numbers are not known, as Lukačovič and Seznam officials have never released any details about the transaction.[citation needed] What has been confirmed, though, is that Ivo Lukačovič retained at least 70% of Seznam stock after the investment.[7] Spray acquired a stake in Seznam with the intention of making an IPO; however, Spray never reached that goal. After the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Spray abandoned the idea. There are rumors about Spray defaulting on its obligations to Ivo Lukačovič by not making an IPO.[8] In 2003, Ivo Lukačovič increased the base capital of Seznam without Spray and became 70% owner of Seznam. Since 2003, Ivo Lukačovič has remained the controlling shareholder of Seznam.[citation needed] Until 2003, Seznam had been using a fulltext engine from the Czech company Jyxo; however, in 2005, Seznam replaced that search engine with its own technology. Also in 2005, Seznam acquired the Czech firm ATC which was, among other ventures, running the email server Email.cz. Email services Email.cz and Seznam.cz have now merged.[9] In 2006, Seznam moved its headquarters from Prague Košíře to a more prominent location in the Prague Anděl. That year, Ivo Lukačovič gave up the day-to-day business direction of Seznam, and Pavel Zima became CEO. In the Fall of 2006, Seznam acquired all email users from another web portal, \"Czech On Line\", with the domain @post.cz.[10] Seznam bought 50% of Global Inspiration, a Czech company running a video portal Stream.cz, similar to the global YouTube in 2007. Lycos Europe (a subsequent incarnation of Spray International) sold its 30% share in Seznam to Tiger Holding and Miura International. Lycos received more than 1.7 billion CZK from this transaction.[11] As of 2015, Miura International S.a.r.l. had 5,6% of shares, Tiger holding four S.a.r.l. had 24,4% of shares and Helifreak limited had 70% of shares.[12] In 2008, the Czech media reported on alleged meetings between Seznam and Goldman Sachs representatives to find a buyer for Se",

As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO involves understanding how search engines operate, the algorithms that shape their results, the information users seek, the keywords and queries they enter, and the specific search engines favored by the intended audience. SEO helps websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher within a search engine results page (SERP), aiming to either convert the visitors or build brand awareness.[5] History Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Search engine users would query the URL of a page, and then receive information found on the page, if it existed in the search engine\u0027s index. ALIWEB and the earliest versions of search engines required website developers to manually upload website index files in order to be searchable and widely did not utilize any form of ranking algorithm for user queries.[6] The emergence of automated web crawlers would later be used to proactively discover and index websites. This led to website developers to optimize their website’s search signals, including the use of meta tags, to achieve greater visibility in search results. According to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current Google employee Danny Sullivan, the phrase \"search engine optimization\" came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits SEO practitioner Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.[7] In some cases, early search algorithms weighted particular HTML attributes in ways that could be leveraged by web content providers to manipulate their search rankings.[8] As early as 1997, search engine providers began adjusting their algorithms to prevent these actions.[9] Eventually, search engines would incorporate more meaningful measures of page purpose, including the more recent development of semantic search.[10] Some search engines frequently sponsor SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization.[11][12] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website.[13] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the \"crawl rate\", and track the web pages index status. In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products, resulting in brands and marketers shifting toward mobile-first experiences.[14] In the 2020s, the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini gave rise to discussion around a concept variously referred to as generative engine optimization, answer engine optimization or artificial intelligence optimization. This approach focuses on optimizing content for inclusion in AI-generated answers provided by large language models (LLMs). This shift has led digital marketers to discuss content formats, authority signals, and how structured data is presented to make content mor",

Servers similar to this one are often used as web servers. Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website. Server farm with thousands of web servers used for super-high traffic websites ADSL modem running an embedded web server serving dynamic web pages used for modem configuration A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1][2][3][4][5] The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.[6] A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications. Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages.

The case label reads: \"This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!\" See also: History of the web browser, History of the World Wide Web, and History of the Internet This is a very brief history of web server programs, so some information necessarily overlaps with the histories of the web browsers, the World Wide Web and the Internet; therefore, for the sake of clarity and understandability, some key historical information below reported may be similar to that found also in one or more of the above-mentioned history articles.[7] Initial WWW project (1989–1991) [edit] In March 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system. The proposal titled \"HyperText and CERN\", asked for comments and it was read by several people. In October 1990 the proposal was reformulated and enriched (having as co-author Robert Cailliau), and finally, it was approved.[8][9][10] Between late 1990 and early 1991 the project resulted in Berners-Lee and his developers writing and testing several software libraries along with three programs, which initially ran on NeXTSTEP OS installed on NeXT workstations:[11][12][10] a graphical web browser, called WorldWideWeb; a portable line mode web browser; a web server, later known as CERN httpd. Those early browsers retrieved web pages written in a simple early form of HTML from web servers using a new basic communication protocol that was named HTTP 0.9. In August 1991 Tim Berners-Lee announced the birth of WWW technology and encouraged scientists to adopt and develop it.[13] Soon after, those programs, along with their source code, were made available to people interested in their usage.[11] Although the source code was not formally licensed or placed in the public domain, CERN informally allowed users and developers to experiment and further develop on top of them. Berners-Lee started promoting the adoption and the usage of those programs along with their porting to other operating systems.[10] Fast and wild development (1991–1995) [edit] In December 1991, the first web server outside Europe was installed at SLAC (U.S.A.).[12] This was a very important event because it started trans-continental web communications between web browsers and web servers.

Filter bubbles are seen as critical enablers of Brexit, Trump, Bolsonaro, and other populist political phenomena, and search and social media companies have been criticised for failing to prevent their development. Yet, there is scant empirical evidence for their existence, or for the related concept of \u0027echo chambers\u0027: indeed, search and social media users generally appear to encounter a highly centrist media diet that is, if anything, more diverse than that of non-users. However, the persistent use of these concepts in mainstream media and political debates has now created its own discursive reality that continues to impact materially on societal institutions, media and communication platforms, and ordinary users themselves. This article provides a critical review of the \u0027filter bubble\u0027 idea, and concludes that its persistence has served only to redirect scholarly attention from far more critical areas of enquiry.

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Doi (identifier)) ISO standard unique string identifier for a digital object This article is about a persistent identifier. For the use of digital object identifiers on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Digital Object Identifier. For other uses, see Doi (disambiguation). Digital object identifier Full name Digital Object Identifier Acronym DOI Organisation International DOI Foundation Introduced October 1997; 28 years ago (1997-10)[1] Example 10.1000/182 Website www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/ A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify various objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[2] DOIs are an implementation of the Handle System;[3][4] they also fit within the URI system (Uniform Resource Identifier). They are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. A DOI aims to resolve to its target, the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL where the object is located. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from ISBNs or ISRCs which are identifiers only. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model to represent metadata. The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI should provide a more stable link than directly using its URL. But if its URL changes, the publisher must update the metadata for the DOI to maintain the link to the URL.[5][6][7] It is the publisher\u0027s responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link, leaving the DOI useless.[8] The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000.[9] Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs.[10] The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF.[11] The cumulative number of DOIs has increased exponentially over time, from 50 million registrations in 2011 to 391 million in 2025.[12] The rate of registering organizations (\"members\") has also increased over time from 4,000 in 2011 to 9,500 in 2013, but the federated nature of the system means it is not immediately clear how many members there are in total today.[13] Fake registries have even appeared.[14] Nomenclature and syntax [edit] A DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash. prefix/suffix\n The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is a number greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.[15][16] The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.[17] For example, in the DOI name 10.1000/182, the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182. The \"10\" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,[A] and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. 182 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the DOI Handbook). DOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, performances, and abstract works[18] such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc. The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model. Display [edit] The official DOI Handbook explicitly states that DOIs should be displayed on screens and in print in the format doi:10.1000/182.[19] Contrary to the DOI Handbook, Crossref, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) instead of the officially specified format.[20][21] The DOI Foundation guarantees these URLs to be persistent[22] i.e. such URLs are PURLs — providing the location of a name resolv",

For other uses, see Search engine (disambiguation). This article\u0027s tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia\u0027s guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message) A Google search result for the phrase \"magic flute opera\" A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user\u0027s query. The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

In 2017, the name was formally changed to OCLC, Inc.[4] OCLC and thousands of its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog in the world.[5] OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries pay (around $217.8 million annually in total as of 2021[update]) for the many different services it offers.[2] OCLC also maintains the Dewey Decimal Classification system. History [edit] OCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for libraries in the state of Ohio. The group first met on July 5, 1967, on the campus of Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization[6] and hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, as first executive director.[7][8] Kilgour and Ralph H. Parker, who was the head of libraries at the University of Missouri, had proposed the shared cataloging system in a 1965 report as consultants to the Committee of Librarians of the Ohio College Association.[8] Kilgour and Parker wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library.[8] They were inspired in part by the earlier Columbia–Harvard–Yale Medical Libraries Computerization Project, an attempt at shared automated printing of catalog cards.[8] The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management, bringing libraries together cooperatively to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide.[6] Between 1967 and 1977, OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio, but in 1978, a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join. With this expansion, the name changed to the Online Computer Library Center in 1977.[9] In 2002, the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States.[10] As OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio, it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with \"networks\", organizations that provided training, support and marketing services. By 2008, there were 15 independent United States regional service providers. OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance, with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council. During 2008, OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels; at the same time, the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance. In early 2009, OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center.[11] In July 2010, the company was sued by SkyRiver, a rival startup, in an antitrust suit.[12] Library automation company Innovative Interfaces joined SkyRiver in the suit.[13] The suit was dropped in March 2013, however, following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces.[14] Innovative Interfaces was bought by ExLibris in 2020, therefore passing OCLC as the dominant supplier of ILS services in the U.S. (over 70% market share for academic libraries and over 50% for public libraries for ExLibris, versus OCLC\u0027s 10% market share of both types of libraries in 2019).[15] In 2022, membership and governance expanded to include any institution with a subscription to one",

He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4] Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989[5][6] and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.[7][8][9][10][11] He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web\u0027s subsequent development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In 2009, he was elected Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.[12][13] Berners-Lee was previously a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder\u0027s chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[14] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)[15] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[16][17] In 2011, he was named a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[18] He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is an advisor at social network MeWe.[19] In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[20][21] He received the 2016 Turing Award \"for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale\".[22] He was named in Time magazine\u0027s list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.[23] Early life Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955,[24] the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Berners-Lee (née Woods; 1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management. Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973.[1][20] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[25] In 1976, Berners-Lee took a first in physics from The Queen\u0027s College, Oxford.[1][24] While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.[26] Career and research Berners-Lee, 2005 After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset.[24] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.[24] Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.[27] To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.[28] After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole\u0027s Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.[29] He ran the company\u0027s technical side for three years.[30] The project he worked on was a \"real-time remote procedure call\" which gave him experience in computer networking.[29] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.[28] In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet: I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web. — Tim Berners-Lee[31] Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working a",

For the technology boom and bust phenomenon, see Social media stock bubble. Social media inadvertently isolates users into their own ideological filter bubbles, according to internet activist Eli Pariser. A filter bubble is a state of intellectual isolation[1] that arises when personalized searches, recommendation systems, and algorithmic curation selectively presents information to each user. The search results are based on information about the user, such as their location, past click-behavior, and search history.[2] As a result, users are increasingly exposed to information that reinforces their existing beliefs while also separating themselves from content that challenges them. This has effectively enclosed individuals from a cultural or ideological bubble, resulting in a narrow and more customized view of the world.[3] The choices made by these algorithms are only sometimes transparent.[4] Prime examples include Google Personalized Search results and Facebook\u0027s personalized news-stream. However, there are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalized filtering happens and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful, with various studies producing inconclusive results. The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser circa 2010. In Pariser\u0027s influential book under the same name, The Filter Bubble (2011), it was predicted that individualized personalization by algorithmic filtering would lead to intellectual isolation and social fragmentation.[5] The bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse, according to Pariser, but contrasting views regard the effect as minimal[6] and addressable.[7] According to Pariser, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their informational bubble.[8] He related an example in which one user searched Google for \"BP\" and got investment news about BP, while another searcher got information about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, noting that the two search results pages were \"strikingly different\" despite use of the same key words.[8][9][10][6] The results of the U.S. presidential election in 2016 have been associated with the influence of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,[11] and as a result have called into question the effects of the \"filter bubble\" phenomenon on user exposure to fake news and echo chambers,[12] spurring new interest in the term,[13] with many concerned that the phenomenon may harm democracy and well-being by making the effects of misinformation worse.[14][15][13][16][17][18] Concept [edit] The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser, circa 2010. Pariser defined his concept of a filter bubble in more formal terms as \"that personal ecosystem of information that\u0027s been catered by these algorithms.\"[8] An internet user\u0027s past browsing and search history is built up over time when they indicate interest in topics by \"clicking links, viewing friends, putting movies in [their] queue, reading news stories,\" and so forth.[19] An internet firm then uses this information to target advertising to the user, or make certain types of information appear more prominently in search results pages.[19] This process is not random, as it operates under a three-step process, per Pariser, who states, \"First, you figure out who people are and what they like. Then, you provide them with content and services that best fit them. Finally, you tune in to get the fit just right. Your identity shapes your media.\"[20] Pariser also reports: According to one Wall Street Journal study, the top fifty Internet sites, from CNN to Yahoo to MSN, install an average of 64 data-laden cookies and personal tracking beacons. Search for a word like \"depression\" on Dictionary.com, and the site installs up to 223 tracking cookies and beacons on your computer so that other Web sites can target you with antidepressants. Share an article about cooking on ABC News, and you may be chased around the Web by ads for Teflon-coated pots. Open—even for an instant—a page listing signs that your spouse may be cheating and prepare to be haunted by DNA paternity-test ads.[21] Accessing the data of link clicks displayed through site traffic measurements determines that filter bubbles can be collective or individual.[22] As of 2011, one engineer had told Pariser that Google looked at 57 different pieces of data to personally tailor a user\u0027s search results, including non-cookie data such as the type of computer being used and the user\u0027s physical location.[23] Pariser\u0027s idea of the filter bubble was popularized after the TED talk in May 2011, in which he gave examples of how filter bubbles work and where they can be seen. In a test seeking to demonstrate the filter bubble effect, Pariser asked several friends to search for the word \"Egypt\" on Googl",

The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images.

For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine\u0027s response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %).[1] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google\u0027s share has fallen below the 90% threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.

    "title": "Handle System - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Hdl (identifier)) Specification for persistent identifiers of Internet resources The Handle System is a proprietary registry assigning persistent identifiers, or handles, to information resources, and for resolving \"those handles into the information necessary to locate, access, and otherwise make use of the resources\".[1] As with handles used elsewhere in computing, Handle System handles are opaque, and encode no information about the underlying resource, being bound only to metadata regarding the resource. Consequently, the handles are not rendered invalid by changes to the metadata. The system was developed by Bob Kahn at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) as a part of the Digital Object Architecture (DOA). The original work was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) between 1992 and 1996, as part of a wider framework for distributed digital object services,[2] and was thus contemporaneous with the early deployment of the World Wide Web, with similar goals. The Handle System was first implemented in autumn 1994, and was administered and operated by CNRI until December 2015, when a new \"multi-primary administrator\" (MPA) mode of operation was introduced. The DONA Foundation[3] now administers the system\u0027s Global Handle Registry and accredits MPAs, including CNRI and the International DOI Foundation.[4] The system currently provides the underlying infrastructure for such handle-based systems as Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and DSpace, which are mainly used to provide access to scholarly, professional and government documents and other information resources. CNRI provides specifications and the source code for reference implementations for the servers and protocols used in the system under a royalty-free \"Public License\", similar to an open source license.[5] Thousands of handle services are currently running. Over 1000 of these are at universities and libraries, but they are also in operation at national laboratories, research groups, government agencies, and commercial enterprises, receiving over 200 million resolution requests per month.[citation needed] Specifications [edit] The Handle System is defined in informational RFCs 3650,[1] 3651[6] and 3652[7] of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); it includes an open set of protocols, a namespace, and a reference implementation of the protocols. Documentation, software, and related information is provided by CNRI on a dedicated website[8] Handles consist of a prefix which identifies a \"naming authority\" and a suffix which gives the \"local name\" of a resource. Similar to domain names, prefixes are issued to naming authorities by one of the \"multi-primary administrators\" of the system upon payment of a fee, which must be renewed annually. A naming authority may create any number of handles, with unique \"local names\", within their assigned prefixes. Two example of handles are: 20.1000/100 2381/12345 In the first example, which is the handle for the HANDLE.NET software license, 20.1000 is the prefix assigned to the naming authority (in this case, Handle.net itself) and 100 is the local name within that namespace. The local name may consist of any characters from the Unicode UCS-2 character set. The prefix also consists of any UCS-2 characters, other than \"/\". The prefixes consist of one or more naming authority segments, separated by periods, representing a hierarchy of naming authorities. Thus, in the example 20 is the naming authority prefix for CNRI, while 1000 designates a subordinate naming authority within the 20 prefix. Other examples of top-level prefixes for the federated naming authorities of the DONA Foundation are 10 for DOI handles; 11 for handles assigned by the ITU; 21 for handles issued by the German Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG), the scientific computing center of the University of Göttingen; and 86 for the Coalition of Handle Services – China. Older \"legacy\" prefixes issued by CNRI before the \"multi-primary administrator\" (MPA) structure was instituted are typically four of five digits, as in the second example above, a handle administered by the University of Leicester. All prefixes must be registered in the Global Handle Registry through an DONA Foundation approved registrar, normally for a fee. As with other uses of handles in computing, the handle is opaque; that is, it encodes no information about the underlying resource and provides only the means to retrieve metadata about the resource. This may be contrasted with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which may encode within the identifier such attributes of the resource as the protocol to be used to access the server holding the resource, the server host name and port number, and perhaps even location specifics such as the name of a file in the server file system containing the resource. In the Handle System, these speci",

Inc. Spouse Angela Buenning Children 1 David Robert Filo (born April 20, 1966) is an American billionaire businessman and the co-founder of Yahoo! with classmate Jerry Yang. His Filo Server Program, written in the C programming language, was the server-side software used to dynamically serve variable web pages, called Filo Server Pages, on visits to early versions of the Yahoo! website.[2][3] Early life and education [edit] Filo was born in Wisconsin and was raised in Moss Bluff, Louisiana.[citation needed] He earned a B.S. degree in computer engineering at Tulane University (through the Dean\u0027s Honor Scholarship) and an M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1990 at Stanford University.[4] Career [edit] In February 1994, he co-created with Jerry Yang an Internet website called \"Jerry and David\u0027s Guide to the World Wide Web\", consisting of a directory of other websites. It was renamed \"Yahoo!\" - a common exclamation. Yahoo! became very popular, and Filo and Yang realized the business potential and co-founded Yahoo! Inc.[5][6] Yahoo! started off as a web portal with a web directory providing an extensive range of products and services for various online activities. Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. It is still one of the leading internet brands and, due to partnerships with telecommunications firms, is one of the most visited websites on the internet.[7][8] Personal life [edit] Filo is married to photographer and teacher Angela Buenning, a graduate of Stanford (1993) and Berkeley (1999).[9] They have one child, and live in Palo Alto, California.[4] In 2005, he gave $30 million to his alma mater, Tulane University, for use in its School of Engineering.[4] The Filos have been major benefactors of both Stanford, especially its schools of sustainability and education, and Berkeley, primarily its graduate school of journalism.[10][11][12] As of September 2019, Forbes estimated Filo to be worth $4.3 billion, ranking him the 379th-richest person in the world.[4] References [edit] ^ Centennial Year Commencement Exercises, Stanford University, June 16, 1991, p. 69, archived from the original on December 22, 2019, retrieved June 26, 2018 ^ Gobry, Pascal-Emmanuel. \"10 Behind-The-Scenes Crankers Who Built The World\u0027s Greatest Startups\".

Advertising aims to present a product or service in terms of utility, advantages, and qualities of interest to consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are a wide range of uses, the most common being commercial advertisement. Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through \"branding\", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations, and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images, he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.[1] Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, \"Madison Avenue\" advertising.[2][3] Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion.[4] Advertising\u0027s projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor, and 4.3% on radio.[5] Internationally, the largest (\"Big Five\") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu.[6] History Main article: History of advertising Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at Jinan, Song dynasty China. It is the world\u0027s earliest identified printed advertising medium. Edo period LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called Kinseitan Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters.[7] Commercial messages and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of Pompeii and ancient Arabia. Lost and found advertising on papyrus was common in ancient Greece and ancient Rome. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian rock art paintings that date back to 4000 BC.[8] In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the Classic of Poetry (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell confectionery. Advertisement usually takes the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper pri",

    "content": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Act of retrieving and searching on a social searching engine Social search is a behavior of retrieving and searching on a social searching engine that mainly searches user-generated content such as news, videos and images related search queries on social media like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Flickr.[1] It is an enhanced version of web search that combines traditional algorithms. The idea behind social search is that instead of ranking search results purely based on semantic relevance between a query and the results, a social search system also takes into account social relationships between the results and the searcher.[2][3][4] The social relationships could be in various forms. For example, in LinkedIn people search engine, the social relationships include social connections between searcher and each result, whether or not they are in the same industries, work for the same companies, belong the same social groups, and go the same schools, etc.[2][5] Social search may not be demonstrably better than algorithm-driven search.[6] In the algorithmic ranking model that search engines used in the past, relevance of a site is determined after analyzing the text and content on the page and link structure of the document. In contrast, search results with social search highlight content that was created or touched by other users who are in the Social Graph of the person conducting a search. It is a personalized search technology with online community filtering to produce highly personalized results.[7] Social search takes many forms, ranging from simple shared bookmarks or tagging of content with descriptive labels to more sophisticated approaches that combine human intelligence with computer algorithms. Depending on the feature-set of a particular search engine, these results may then be saved and added to community search results, further improving the relevance of results for future searches of that keyword. The principle behind social search is that human network oriented results would be more meaningful and relevant for the user, instead of computer algorithms deciding the results for specific queries.[8][9][10][11] Research and implementations [edit] Over the years, there have been different studies, researches and some implementations of Social Search. In 2008, there were a few startup companies that focused on ranking search results according to one\u0027s social graph on social networks.[12][13] Companies in the social search space include Sproose, Mahalo, Jumper 2.0, Scour, Wink, Eurekster, and Delver. Former efforts include Wikia Search. In 2008, a story on TechCrunch showed Google potentially adding in a voting mechanism to search results similar to Digg\u0027s methodology.[14] This suggests growing interest in how social groups can influence and potentially enhance the ability of algorithms to find meaningful data for end users. There are also other services like Sentiment that turn search personal by searching within the users\u0027 social circles. In 2009, a startup project called HeyStaks (www.heystaks.com) developed a web browser plugin \"HayStaks\". HeyStaks applies social search through collaboration in web search as a way that leads to better search results.[15] The main motivation for HeyStaks to work on this idea is to provide the user with features that search engines didn\u0027t provide at that time. For instance, different searches have indicated that about 70% of the time when user search for something, a friend or a coworker have found it already. Also, studies have shown that approximately, 30% of people who use online search, search for something that they have found before.[16] The startup believe that they help avoid these kind of issues by providing a shared and rich search experience through a list of recommendations that get generated based on search results. In October 2009, Google rolled out its \"Social Search\"; after a time in beta, the feature was expanded to multiple languages in May 2011. Before the expansion however in 2010 Bing and Google were already taking into account re-tweets and Likes when providing search results.[17] However, after a search deal with Twitter ended without renewal, Google began to retool its Social Search. In January 2012, Google released \"Search plus Your World\", a further development of Social Search. The feature, which is integrated into Google\u0027s regular search as an opt-out feature, pulls references to results from Google+ profiles. The goal was to deliver better, more relevant and personalized search results with this integration. This integration however had some problems in which Google+ still is not wildly adopted or has much usage among many users.[18] Later on, Google was criticized by Twitter for the perceived potential impact of \"Search plus Your World\" upon web publishers, describing the feature\u0027s release to the public as a \"bad day for the web\", while Google replied that Twitter refused to ",

The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable. To enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF)[2] and Web Ontology Language (OWL)[3] are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.[4] These standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\"[5] The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems. History [edit] The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web)[6] that can be processed by machines[7]—that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in library and information science, industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.[8] Berners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web in 1999 as follows: I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.[9] The 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web.[10] In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: \"This simple idea…remains largely unrealized\".[11] In 2013, more than four million Web domains (out of roughly 250 million total) contained Semantic Web markup.[12] Example [edit] In the following example, the text \"Paul Schuster was born in Dresden\" on a website will be annotated, connecting a person with their place of birth. The following HTML fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in RDFa-syntax using a schema.org vocabulary and a Wikidata ID: \u003cdiv vocab\u003d\"https://schema.org/\" typeof\u003d\"Person\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan property\u003d\"name\"\u003ePaul Schuster\u003c/span\u003e was born in\n  \u003cspan property\u003d\"birthPlace\" typeof\u003d\"Place\" href\u003d\"https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\"\u003e\n    \u003cspan property\u003d\"name\"\u003eDresden\u003c/span\u003e.\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n Graph resulting from the RDFa example The example defines the following five triples (shown in Turtle syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the subject) is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the predicate) the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the object) either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).  _:a \u003chttps://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/Person\u003e .\n _:a \u003chttps://schema.org/name\u003e \"Paul Schuster\" .\n _:a \u003chttps://schema.org/birthPlace\u003e \u003chttps://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\u003e .\n \u003chttps://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/itemtype\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/Place\u003e .\n \u003chttps://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\u003e \u003chttps://schema.org/name\u003e \"Dresden\" .\n The triples result in the graph shown in the given figure.

As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO involves understanding how search engines operate, the algorithms that shape their results, the information users seek, the keywords and queries they enter, and the specific search engines favored by the intended audience. SEO helps websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher within a search engine results page (SERP), aiming to either convert the visitors or build brand awareness.[5] History Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Search engine users would query the URL of a page, and then receive information found on the page, if it existed in the search engine\u0027s index. ALIWEB and the earliest versions of search engines required website developers to manually upload website index files in order to be searchable and widely did not utilize any form of ranking algorithm for user queries.[6] The emergence of automated web crawlers would later be used to proactively discover and index websites. This led to website developers to optimize their website’s search signals, including the use of meta tags, to achieve greater visibility in search results. According to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current Google employee Danny Sullivan, the phrase \"search engine optimization\" came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits SEO practitioner Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.[7] In some cases, early search algorithms weighted particular HTML attributes in ways that could be leveraged by web content providers to manipulate their search rankings.[8] As early as 1997, search engine providers began adjusting their algorithms to prevent these actions.[9] Eventually, search engines would incorporate more meaningful measures of page purpose, including the more recent development of semantic search.[10] Some search engines frequently sponsor SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization.[11][12] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website.[13] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the \"crawl rate\", and track the web pages index status. In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products, resulting in brands and marketers shifting toward mobile-first experiences.[14] In the 2020s, the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini gave rise to discussion around a concept variously referred to as generative engine optimization, answer engine optimization or artificial intelligence optimization. This approach focuses on optimizing content for inclusion in AI-generated answers provided by large language models (LLMs). This shift has led digital marketers to discuss content formats, authority signals, and how stru",
