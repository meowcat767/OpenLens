Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[34] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5,[35] capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing.[36] As of 2025[update], the Python Software Foundation supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, following the projects annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates. Python has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[37][38][39][40] It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.[41] Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.[42] History Main article: History of Python The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at PyCon US 2024 Python was conceived in the late 1980s[43] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde \u0026 Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.[44] It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[45] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Python implement",

PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.[13] It is supported on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses, data lakes,[14] or web services with many concurrent users. The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components. This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor. These include special-purpose database engine features, like those needed to support a geospatial[15] or temporal[16] database or features which emulate other database products.[17][18][19][20] Also available from third parties are a wide variety of user and machine interface features, such as graphical user interfaces[21][22][23] or load balancing and high availability toolsets.[24] The large third-party PostgreSQL support network of people, companies, products, and projects, even though not part of The PostgreSQL Development Group, are essential to the PostgreSQL database engine\u0027s adoption and use and make up the PostgreSQL ecosystem writ large.[25] PostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.[26][27] In 1996, the project was renamed PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.[28] History [edit] Ingres and University POSTGRES (1982–1994) [edit] PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, Michael Stonebraker, left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres.[26] He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the Turing Award in 2014 for these and other projects,[29] and techniques pioneered in them. The new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types.[30] These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships – something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.[31] Starting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM SIGMOD Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers[32] and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2[33] on June 30, 1994 – primarily a cleanup – the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter, which could be interactively used with a console application named monitor. Postgres95 (1994–1996) [edit] In 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. The monitor console was also replaced by psql. Yu a",

It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.[19] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022[update] according to GitHub.[20] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[21] Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun\u0027s Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle, which bought Sun in 2010, offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM, which is open-source software used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. Java 25 is the version current as of September 2025[update]. Java 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25 are long-term support versions still under maintenance. History See also: Java (software platform) § History Duke, the Java mascot James Gosling, the creator of Java, in 2008 James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[22] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[23] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling\u0027s office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[24] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[25] Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[26] It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[27] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively. In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[28][29][30] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[31] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementatio",

Servers similar to this one are often used as web servers. Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website. Server farm with thousands of web servers used for super-high traffic websites ADSL modem running an embedded web server serving dynamic web pages used for modem configuration A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1][2][3][4][5] The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.[6] A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications. Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages. History [edit] First web proposal (1989) evaluated as \"vague but exciting...\" The world\u0027s first web server, a NeXT Computer workstation with Ethernet, 1990. The case label reads: \"This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!\" See also: History of the web browser, History of the World Wide Web, and History of the Internet This is a very brief history of web server programs, so some information necessarily overlaps with the histories of the web browsers, the World Wide Web and the Internet; therefore, for the sake of clarity and understandability, some key historical information below reported may be similar to that found also in one or more of the above-mentioned history articles.[7] Initial WWW project (1989–1991) [edit] In March 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system. The proposal titled \"HyperText and CERN\", asked for comments and it was read by several people. In October 1990 the proposal was reformulated and enriched (having as co-author Robert Cailliau), and finally, it was approved.[8][9][10] Between late 1990 and early 1991 the project resulted in Berners-Lee and his developers writing and testing several software libraries along with three programs, which initially ran on NeXTSTEP OS installed on NeXT workstations:[11][12][10] a graphical web browser, called WorldWideWeb; a portable line mode web browser; a web server, later known as CERN httpd. Those early browsers retrieved web pages written in a simple early form of HTML from web servers using a new basic communication protocol that was named HTTP 0.9. In August 1991 Tim Berners-Lee announced the birth of WWW technology and encouraged scientists to adopt and develop it.[13] Soon after, those programs, along with their source code, were made available to people interested in their usage.[11] Although the source code was not formally licensed or placed in the public domain, CERN informally allowed users and developers to experiment and further develop on top of them. Berners-Lee started promoting the adoption and the usage of those programs along with their porting to other operating systems.[10] Fast and wild development (1991–1995) [edit] In December 1991, the first web server outside Europe was installed at SLAC (U.S.A.).[12] This was a very important event because it started trans-continental web communications between web browsers and web servers.

The window decoration is either drawn by the window manager or by the client. The drawing of the content is the task of the client. In computing, a windowing system (or window system) is a software suite that manages separately different parts of display screens.[1] It is a type of graphical user interface (GUI) which implements the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) paradigm for a user interface. Each currently running application is assigned a usually resizable and usually rectangular surface of the display to present its GUI to the user; these windows may overlap each other, as opposed to a tiling interface where they are not allowed to overlap. Usually a window decoration is drawn around each window. The programming of both the window decoration and of available widgets inside of the window, which are graphical elements for direct user interaction, such as sliders, buttons, etc., is eased and simplified through the use of widget toolkits. Technical details [edit] The main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server, although alternative terms such as window server are also in use. Any application that runs and presents its GUI in a window, is a client of the display server. The display server and its clients communicate with each other over an application programming interface (API) or a communications protocol, which is usually called display server protocol, the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user. It receives all the input from the kernel, that the kernel receives from all attached input devices, such as keyboard, pointing devices, or touchscreen and transmits it to the correct client. The display server is also responsible for the output of the clients to the computer monitor. The output of sound is usually not managed by the display server, but the sound volume is usually handled through GUI applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top. A windowing system enables the computer user to work with several programs at the same time. Each program presents its GUI in its own window, which is generally a rectangular area of the screen.[citation needed] From a programmer\u0027s point of view, a windowing system implements graphical primitives. For example: rendering fonts or drawing a line on the screen. It provides an abstraction of the graphics hardware for use by higher-level elements of the graphical interface such as a window manager.[citation needed] A display server protocol can be network capable or even network transparent, facilitating the implementation of thin clients.[citation needed] Display server [edit] The basic components of a GUI: The display server implements the windowing system. A simple window manager merely draws the window decorations, but compositing window managers do more. A display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other. The display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol, a communications protocol, which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable. The display server is a key component in any graphical user interface, specifically the windowing system. The server/client relationship of a standalone display server is somewhat counterintuitive in that a \"server\" is usually thought of as a large, remote machine, whereas a standalone \"display server\" is a small local system, with most clients being executed on a larger central machine. The explanation is that a display server provides the services of a display and input devices. Display server communications protocols [edit] X11 [edit] Main articles: X Window System core protocol and X Window System The X.Org Server communicates with X clients (local or remote) and peripherals over the X11 protocol. X Window System logo The X Window System was first released in 1984 and is historically the main windowing system for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The core protocol has been at version 11 since 1987, hence it commonly being known as \"X11\". The current reference implementation of the X11 protocol is the X.Org Server, which provides the display server and some ancillary components. The X Window System does not define a look and feel; instead, users run a window manager (either standalone or part of a broader desktop environment) and applications designed using a widget toolkit.

License GPLv2 (Linux kernel)[14][f] Official website kernel.org Articles in the series Linux kernel Linux distribution Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks)[16] is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[17] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[18][19][20] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.[21] Thousands of Linux distributions exist, many based directly or indirectly on other distributions;[22][23] popular Linux distributions[24][25][26] include Debian, Fedora Linux, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu, while commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and ChromeOS. Linux distributions are frequently used in server platforms.[27][28] Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and recommends the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.[29][30] Other than the Linux kernel, key components that make up a distribution may include a display server (windowing system), a package manager, a bootloader and a Unix shell. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. While originally developed for x86 based personal computers, it has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system,[31] and is used on a wide variety of devices including PCs, workstations, mainframes and embedded systems. Linux is the predominant operating system for servers and is also used on all of the world\u0027s 500 fastest supercomputers.[g] When combined with Android, which is Linux-based and designed for smartphones, they have the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. Overview [edit] The Linux kernel was designed by Linus Torvalds, following the lack of a working kernel for GNU, a Unix-compatible operating system made entirely of free software that had been undergoing development since 1983 by Richard Stallman. A working Unix system called Minix was later released but its license was not entirely free at the time[32] and it was made for an educative purpose. The first entirely free Unix for personal computers, 386BSD, did not appear until 1992, by which time Torvalds had already built and publicly released the first version of the Linux kernel on the Internet.[33] Like GNU and 386BSD, Linux did not have any Unix code, being a fresh reimplementation, and therefore avoided the legal issues.[34] Linux distributions became popular in the 1990s and effectively made Unix technologies accessible to home users on personal computers whereas previously it had been confined to sophisticated workstations.[35] Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME, KDE Plasma or Xfce. Distributions intended for servers may not have a graphical user interface at all or include a solution stack such as LAMP. The source code of Linux may be used, modified, and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). The license means creating novel distributions is permitted by anyone[36] and is easier than it would be for an operating system such as macOS or Microsoft Windows.[37][38][39] The Linux kernel, for example, is licensed under the GPLv2, with an exception for system calls that allows code that calls the kernel via system ca",

It consists of an outer ring of vertical sarsen standing stones, each around 13 feet (4.0 m) high, seven feet (2.1 m) wide, and weighing around 25 tons, topped by connecting horizontal lintel stones which are held in place with mortise and tenon joints—a feature unique among contemporary monuments.[2][3] Inside is a ring of smaller bluestones. Inside, these are free-standing trilithons, two bulkier vertical sarsens joined by a single lintel. The whole monument, now in ruins, is aligned towards the sunrise on the summer solstice and sunset on the winter solstice. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the densest complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred tumuli (burial mounds).[4] Stonehenge was constructed in several phases beginning about 3100 BC and continuing until about 1600 BC. The famous circle of large sarsen stones was placed between 2600 BC and 2400 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the bluestones were given their current positions between 2400 and 2200 BC,[5] although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC.[6][7][8] One of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom, Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon.[9] It has been a legally protected scheduled monument since the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 was passed.[1] The site and its surroundings were added to UNESCO\u0027s list of World Heritage Sites in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown Estate and managed by English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.[10][11] Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings.[12] Deposits containing human bone date from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were first dug, and continued for at least another 500 years.[13] Etymology Watercolour of Stonehenge by Lucas de Heere, 1574[a] The Oxford English Dictionary cites Ælfric\u0027s 10th-century glossary, in which henge-cliff is given the meaning \u0027precipice\u0027, or stone; thus, the stanenges or Stanheng \"not far from Salisbury\" recorded by 11th-century writers are \"stones supported in the air\". In 1740, William Stukeley notes: \"Pendulous rocks are now called henges in Yorkshire ... I doubt not, Stonehenge in Saxon signifies the hanging stones.\"[16] Christopher Chippindale\u0027s Stonehenge Complete gives the derivation of the name Stonehenge as coming from the Old English words stān \u0027stone\u0027, and either hencg \u0027hinge\u0027 (because the stone lintels hinge on the upright stones) or hen(c)en \u0027to hang\u0027 or \u0027gallows\u0027 or \u0027instrument of torture\u0027 (though elsewhere in his book, Chippindale cites the \u0027suspended stones\u0027 etymology).[17] The \"henge\" portion has given its name to a class of monuments known as henges.[16] Archaeologists define henges as earthworks consisting of a circular banked enclosure with an internal ditch.[18] As often happens in archaeological terminology, this is a holdover from antiquarian use.

Holes that no longer, or never, contained stones are shown as open circles. Stones visible today are shown coloured. Mike Parker Pearson, leader of the Stonehenge Riverside Project based around Durrington Walls, noted that Stonehenge appears to have been associated with burial from the earliest period of its existence: Stonehenge was a place of burial from its beginning to its zenith in the mid third [sic] millennium B.C.

It is located on the island of Great Britain, of which it covers about 62%, and more than 100 smaller adjacent islands. England shares a land border with Scotland to the north and another land border with Wales to the west, and is otherwise surrounded by the North Sea to the east, the English Channel to the south, the Celtic Sea to the south-west, and the Irish Sea to the west. Continental Europe lies to the south-east, and Ireland to the west. At the 2021 census, the population was 56,490,048. London is both the largest city and the capital. The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic. It takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had extensive cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century.[7] The Kingdom of England, which included Wales after 1535, ceased to be a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union brought into effect a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland that created the Kingdom of Great Britain.[8] England is the origin of the English language, the English legal system (which served as the basis for the common law systems of many other countries), association football, and the Anglican branch of Christianity; its parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations.[9] The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world\u0027s first industrialised nation.[10] England is home to the two oldest universities in the English-speaking world: the University of Oxford, founded in 1096, and the University of Cambridge, founded in 1209. Both universities are ranked amongst the most prestigious in the world.[11][12] England\u0027s terrain chiefly consists of low hills and plains, especially in the centre and south. Upland and mountainous terrain is mostly found in the north and west, including Dartmoor, the Lake District, the Pennines, and the Shropshire Hills. The London metropolitan area has a population of over 15 million as of 2025, representing the United Kingdom\u0027s largest metropolitan area. England\u0027s population of 56.3 million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century.[13] Toponymy See also: Toponymy of England The name \"England\" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means \"land of the Angles\".[14] The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages. They came from the Angeln region of what is now the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.[15] The earliest recorded use of the term, as \"Engla londe\", is in the late-ninth-century translation into Old English of Bede\u0027s Ecclesiastical History of the English People. The term was then used to mean \"the land inhabited by the English\", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of Northumbria.

At first a supporter of James Buchanan, whom he succeeded in the Senate when Buchanan became Secretary of State in 1845, Cameron broke with Buchanan and the Democrats by the 1850s. An opponent of slavery, he briefly joined the Know Nothings before winning another term in the Senate as a Republican in 1857. He helped nominate and elect Lincoln, but rumors of corruption surrounded him; it was with reluctance that Lincoln appointed him to the cabinet. He did not do well in his post, and Lincoln made him minister to Russia in 1862, a post he held briefly. He rebuilt his political machine in Pennsylvania, winning a third term in the Senate in 1867. After ten years he resigned, arranging the election of his son, Don Cameron, in his place. Simon Cameron lived to age 90; his machine dominated local politics until the 1920s. (Full article...)

Kao spin-off serije Age of Empires, Age of Mythology crpi dio inspiracije iz mitologije i legendi Grka, Egipćana i Nordijaca, a ne iz stvarnih historijskih događaja. Mnogi elementi igranja slični su serijalu Age of Empires, dok mitološka stvorenja i natprirodne moći igranje podižu izvan područja realizma. Kampanja prati atlantskog admirala Arkantosa, koji je prisiljen putovati kroz zemlje tri kulture u igri, loveći kiklopa koji je u savezu s Posejdonom protiv Atlantide. Age of Mythology bila je komercijalno uspješna igra, dostigavši platinasti tiraž četiri mjeseca nakon izlaska i prodavši preko milion primjeraka. Godine 2003. uslijedio je ekspanzijski paket, Age of Mythology: The Titans. Adaptacija u vidu društvene igre pod nazivom Age of Mythology: The Boardgame, objavljena je 2003. godine od strane firme Eagle Games. Dana 8. maja 2014. godine, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition je objavljen za Windows putem Steama. Nakon toga uslijedio je drugi ekspanzijski paket, Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon, objavljen 28. januara 2016. godine. Dana 4. septembra 2024. godine, objavljen je remaster, Age of Mythology: Retold.

Wikipedija je globalan, višejezični projekt s ciljem izgradnje slobodne internetske enciklopedije koja je svima javno dostupna. Njezini su suradnici dobrovoljci. Wikipedijom danas rukovodi neprofitna organizacija Zaklada Wikimedija. I vi možete uređivati Wikipediju! Biologija Fizika Kemija Glazba Likovna umjetnost Šport Životopisi Povijest Zemljopis Europa Hrvatska Arhiva Članak tjedna Taktilne staze sustav su reljefnih indikatora postavljenih na tlu kako bi slabovidnim osobama-pješacima pomogli pri kretanju, najčešće uz prometnice, stepenice i platforme javnog prijevoza, ali i u zatvorenim prostorima. Imaju distinktivan površinski uzorak traka ili točaka koje se može osjetiti pomoću bijelog štapa ili stopalom. Cilj im je voditi slabovidne osobe kroz prostor te ih upozoriti na nadolazeće puteve, prometnice ili ulice, kao i na potencijalno opasne promjene u površini ili nagibu tla. Prvi sustav taktilnih staza uveden je na pješačkim prijelazima i drugim opasnim prilazima cestama u Japanu 1960-ih. Ujedinjeno Kraljevstvo, Australija i SAD usvojili su standard 1990-ih godina. U Hrvatskoj su zakonski usvojene 2005. godine. Taktilne staze često se pogrešno percipiraju kao staze za bicikle ili romobile.
